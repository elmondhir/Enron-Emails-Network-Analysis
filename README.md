# Enron-Emails-Network-Analysis
The Enron email dataset contains approximately 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. It was obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of Enron's collapse.

This is the May 7, 2015 Version of dataset, as published at https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/

**Note:** The dataset has a very large size of 1.4 GB, and therefore wouldn't makes sense to upload it in this Github repo

The Notebook contains the following steps: 

- EDA
- Data Cleaning
- Feature Extraction
- Visualization (graph)
