Just a reminder that interventions and comments in this proceeding are due 
next Monday, March 19th.  This case concerns a complaint filed by Tuscon 
Electric challenging Governor Davis' and the state of California's 
commandeering of the BFM contracts of SCE and PG&E.  The complaint argues 
that the contracts belong to interstate markets and are beyond the reach of 
the state's eminent domain powers.

While the complaint is consistent with arguments that we have made in the 
past on many issues, I am not clear whether, on a commercial level, EPMI is 
upset that the Governor commandeered the contracts.  My surface analysis is 
that the state is unlikely to pay fair value for the contracts and thus, if 
this is the only consideration, we would be better off if the contracts are 
returned to the PX to use as collateral on SCE's and PG&E's defaults (thereby 
mitigating chargeback exposure).  I am not in position, however, to evaluate 
whether EPMI sees a commercial advantage in buying these contracts from DWR 
as opposed to buying them back from the PX under the liquidation procedures 
announced by the PX before the contracts were commandeered.  FYI, the PX's 
procedures gave counterparties (such as EPMI) first opportunity to buy the 
contracts; when SCE protested this method, we intervened in support of the 
PX's proposal.

We have three courses of action:  (1) file a plain vanilla intervention; (2) 
intervene and file short comments in support of the complaint; or (3) do 
nothing.  Since interventions and comments are due on Monday, please advise 
as soon as possible which course you prefer.  I am available in my office 
(202-828-5872) to discuss.

Thanks.

I think that these are current, but you might want to check with Steve Van

Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.  One general comment:  It may 
be a bit lengthy at this point.  Also, have we decided whether it would be 
our op-ed piece?  

And one key point that is very commercially sensitive:  The term ""end the 
rate freeze"" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the 
timing of any such ""end"" in California.  Thus my heavy-handed edits on that 
portion.

Nice job, Jeannie.

Best,
Jeff

Anne, can we add the new pg&e topock curve to the basis transport tab?  Also, 
the LT transport section is showing the transport positions through 2002, 
which is incorrect.  Please review the transport deals in the model and 
delete the positions.

Subject: NCNG Delivery Points

There would seem to me to be two questions--the threshold one is whether the
site is within Rocky Mount's service territory.  If it is, then what
obligation does NCNG have with respect to the construction of a delivery
point.  I haven't reviewed the annexation statutes yet, but based on my
initial reading of the Service Area Territory Agreement between Rocky Mount
and NCNG, once annexed the site would come within Rocky Mount's purview to
serve, and, although a ""mutually agreeable"" delivery point would have to be
negotiated, NCNG would at least have to negotiate that in good faith.  

The January 13, 1992 Service Area Territory Agreement gives Rocky Mount the
right to distribute natural gas within the city's incorporated limits as
well as a specified area outside the incorporated limits.   The contract
goes on to provide that should any part of that perimeter be annexed into
the city, ""the respective rights of the parties as to service in any such
portion shall be determined by applicable case law and the General Statutes
of North Carolina. . .""  The contract further provides that absent an order
of the NCUC to the contrary, NCNG agrees that Rocky Mount has the right to
serve all end users within the ""aforementioned"" area--presumably referring
to the annexed area, although the agreement is not a model of clarity.

So, at least based on this language, Rocky Mount's right to serve arguably
tracks its incorporated limits, whatever they might be.  (Jonathan and I are
looking at annexation law to see what else might be lurking out there).  

The 1992 Service agreement provides, In Article IV, provides that points of
devliery for all natural gas purchased or transported under the agreement
with NCNG shall be ""at the following locations and other stations added at
mutually agreeable locations in the future. . ."" In the Third Amendment to
the Natural Gas Service Agreement, dated March 10, 1997, new language and
delivery points are negotiated upon, but the principle is still included
that  other stations may be added at ""mutually agreeable locations in the
future.""  The question which then arises is what Rocky Mount would have to
give in exchange.  In the 1997 agreement, Rocky Mount agreed to an extention
of terms of the of ten years, until December 6,

You have probably already seen the trade press accounts of the hearing this 
week, but I wanted to make sure that you see this one, since it is more 
evenhanded and informative, with less rhetoric.

Let me know if you would like me to forward the other articles that I've seen.

FYI - This article is very informative about the options FERC is considering 
to address the California power market situation; no surprises for anyone 
following this closely.  Please note that Chairman Hoecker felt the need to 
emphasize the limitations of FERC's power under the Federal Power Act.


DJ FERC Chief Pledges Action, If Needed, On Calif Pwr Woes
Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.


(This article was originally published Monday)
     WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and 
alleged price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the 
state's wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker 
told a congressional panel Monday.

     The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff 
investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes 
available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing 
of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.

     ""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our 
jurisdiction, we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is 
occurring ""as some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by 
revoking market-based rates or otherwise.""

     However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited 
under the Federal Power Act.

     ""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer 
crisis. Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as 
authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,"" 
Hoecker testified.

     The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers 
""until we have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the 
results of the pending staff investigation.

     Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to 
San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve 
its retail customer base.

     Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power 
Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this 
summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much 
for power as they did a year ago.

     State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis



     The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of 
Sempra Energy (SRE), sought an order setting price caps for power bid into 
the state-sponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an order 
allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent 
grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price controls don't 
apply.

     FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on 
SDG&E's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. 
But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to 
limit the price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid 
into the power exchange.

     Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to 
place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the state-mandated 
market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spot-market 
volatility.

     And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to 
transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission 
organizations, or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional 
solution to the power-supply problem.

     FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in 
California because its experience with new market institutions such as power 
exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.

     Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than 
California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should 
operate,"" Hoecker noted.

     Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the 
commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of 
wholesale markets,"" he said.

     ""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told 
the lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.

     Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the state-mandated 
market structure.

     By requiring the state's three investor-owned utilities to purchase all 
their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge 
price risks by entering into long-term fixed-price contracts, the state left 
consumers subject to volatility in the state-mandated spot market, said 
officials with Enron Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy (REI).

     California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the 
default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately 
passed on to their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.

     ""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity 
to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive director of Utility Consumer's Action Network.

     Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that 
California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the 
country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow 
FERC to better police markets.

     ""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, 
unless policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. 
(ENE) Steven Kean executive vice president.

     ""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues 
that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I 
predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will 
encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin 
Guiles, Sempra's president of regulated operations.

     ""This electricity crisis is not a California-only problem,"" said Rep. 
Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's 
hearing.

     ""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials 
don't work together to find long-term solutions to the flaws in the 
marketplace,"" Bilbray said.

Please note that Chairman Hoecker felt the need to emphasize the limitations of FERC's power under the Federal Power Act.DJ FERC Chief Pledges Action, If Needed, On Calif Pwr WoesCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.(This article was originally published Monday)     WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has limited authority to address flawed electricity markets in California and alleged price gouging by power producers, but will act to overhaul the state's wholesale power markets if necessary, FERC Chairman James Hoecker told a congressional panel Monday.     The commission was ready to act once the results of an expedited staff investigation of problems affecting power markets in the U.S. West becomes available, Hoecker said in testimony presented to a San Diego field hearing of the House Commerce Committee's energy panel.     ""If we need to fix market rules or market structures within our jurisdiction, we will do so,"" Hoecker told lawmakers. And if price gouging is occurring ""as some have alleged,"" he added, ""we will respond accordingly, by revoking marketbased rates or otherwise.""     However, Hoecker stressed that the commission's authority is limited under the Federal Power Act.     ""The commission has limited ability to relieve the immediate customer crisis. Important aspects of this problem are a state responsibility, such as authorizing construction of new generation and transmission facilities,"" Hoecker testified.     The commission can't act to limit prices charged by power providers ""until we have a record supporting such action,"" he said, referring to the results of the pending staff investigation.     Further, he said, the law bars FERC from ordering retroactive refunds to San Diego Gas & Electric Co. for the power it purchased this summer to serve its retail customer base.     Hoecker testified before the House Commerce Committee's Energy and Power Subcommittee, which is looking into the supply shortages in California this summer that have forced San Diego electricity consumers to pay twice as much for power as they did a year ago.     State Mkt Structure Blamed For Crisis     The hearing comes after much wrangling at FERC, as SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), sought an order setting price caps for power bid into the statesponsored electricity exchange, and power producers sought an order allowing cost recovery for lost opportunity sales if the state's independent grid operator curtailed sales outside California, where price controls don't apply.     FERC hasn't yet responded to the producers, and deferred action on SDG&E's bid for price controls until the staff investigation is completed. But it left in place an order allowing the independent system operator to limit the price it pays for power, which acts as a de facto cap on prices bid into the power exchange.     Hoecker, while withholding judgment pending the staff probe, appeared to place much of the blame for this summer's crisis with the statemandated market structure, which left San Diego consumers subject to spotmarket volatility.     And he appeared to suggest that FERC's order directing utilities to transfer transmission assets to control of large regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, will offer an opportunity to develop a regional solution to the powersupply problem.     FERC deferred to California in restructuring the wholesale market in California because its experience with new market institutions such as power exchanges and ISOs was limited, Hoecker said.     Other states, such as Pennsylvania, were ""less prescriptive than California in telling the commission how their wholesale markets should operate,"" Hoecker noted.     Now, with FERC's Order 2000 encouraging formation of RTOs, ""the commission is in a very different posture with respect to the structure of wholesale markets,"" he said.     ""Large regional markets can be made to work effectively,"" Hoecker told the lawmakers, citing the Pennsylvania restructuring as an example.     Other witnesses were more forceful in criticizing the statemandated market structure.     By requiring the state's three investorowned utilities to purchase all their electricity from the power exchange and limiting their ability to hedge price risks by entering into longterm fixedprice contracts, the state left consumers subject to volatility in the statemandated spot market, said officials with Enron Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy (REI).     California's market structure ""placed no economic incentives on the default utility providers to look out for the costs that are ultimately passed on to their consumers,"" Reliant's John Stout testified.     ""San Diego's experience offers the Congress an unparalleled opportunity to learn from a bungled attempt at deregulation,"" said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumer's Action Network.     Shames and other witnesses warned the congressional committee that California's electricity crisis is likely to occur in other regions of the country unless steps are taken to free up interstate trade in power and allow FERC to better police markets.     ""California is just the latest problem area in U.S. power markets and, unless policymakers act quickly, it will not be the last,"" said Enron Corp. (ENE) Steven Kean executive vice president.     ""Unless Congress and FERC are willing to address the interstate issues that are beyond the jurisdiction of state legislators and regulators, I predict that our experience in San Diego is indicative of what others will encounter in trying to create a competitive electricity market,"" said Edwin Guiles, Sempra's president of regulated operations.     ""This electricity crisis is not a Californiaonly problem,"" said Rep. Brian Bilbray, RCalif., who represents San Diego and requested Monday's hearing.     ""We will continue to be in this mess if state and federal officials don't work together to find longterm solutions to the flaws in the marketplace,"" Bilbray said.

Cindy,

I had rather in mind targeting the same audiences to which Mr. Mehta spoke,
not a general  press release. I agree that a general message to the world 
would 
attract attention.

Vince, 

You are a saint for lending me a copy of your book.  I agree with you that we 
don't want increase there revenues even by a $1.00, although my 
recommendation (and Mark Palmer's as well) is that we should pursue a 
rebuttal for the following reasons:

As I mentioned I scoured  the internet (Britannica.com, Amazon.com, yahoo.com 
and Dow Jones) and could not find one mention of the book, therefore Mr. 
Mehta's distribution must not be wide at all.  Consequently, his comments may 
not have reached a large audience.  Issuing a rebuttal, may in fact, draw 
more attention to the comments and issues then they are currently receiving.
I believe we should proceed with caution, and respond accordingly (with 
counter comments) only when comments are solicited from us.  So far, we have 
not received any telephone inquiries from media in relation to Mr. Mehta's 
Enron bashing.  May be we should 'leave the stones unturned'.

Let me know what you think.  Also, please contact me when it is convenient 
for me to borrow the book from you.

Regards,

Cindy

Cindy,

I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
India.
I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
chapters.
I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
the book.

In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
Mehta. The person in charge of
our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
invitation
to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
here for the management 
conference.

Good afternoon Vince,

Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
my search.

I greatly appreciate it.

Regards,

Cindy

Stacey, 

I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because 
their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.  MSN sent me 
the letter below recommending we switch to Southwestern Bell.  Is this what 
ClickatHome suggests that we do?  Will I still receive a reimbursement for 
part of my DSL costs if I switch to SWB?  Please let me know what you suggest.

Thank you, 

Stacy Dickson Granmayeh

Dear MSN Internet Access Customer:

In an effort to help make your transition to another DSL Internet
provider a little easier, we have been working with Southwestern Bell
Internet Services and believe they may have a DSL Internet solution for
you.

Southwestern Bell Internet Services has a special offer for customers
affected by this transition with the following promotion:

Sign up for one-year and receive Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed
Internet Service for $49.95 per month with a free modem (after $99
rebate) and a free self-installation kit, along with no provisioning fees
($149 value).

If you prefer to not commit to a one-year term, you can still sign up for
Southwestern Bell DSL High-Speed Internet Service on a month-to-month
basis for $49.95.

We have identified customers such as yourself who reside in the
Southwestern Bell service area and are recommending you contact them to
see if your telephone number and location qualifies for their DSL
Internet service.? You can contact Southwestern Bell on a special
toll-free number set up just for MSN customers, 1-800-962-5743. So,
hurry, this offer ends on April 30, 2001.

If you qualify, they have a group of specially trained support
representatives to assist you in making a smooth transition to
Southwestern Bell DSL Internet Service.

We hope this information is helpful and again, we apologize for this
situation and appreciate your patience.

Sincerely,
MSN HighSpeed - DSL Team","['Message-ID: <4503109.1075853652375.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Tue, 17 Apr 2001 02:28:00 -0700 (PDT)', 'From: stacy.dickson@enron.com', 'To: stacey.dempsey@enron.com', 'Subject: Fw: Important DSL Information', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit', 'X-From: Stacy E Dickson', 'X-To: Stacey Dempsey', 'X-cc: ', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\Stacey_Dickson_Nov2001\\Notes Folders\\All documents', 'X-Origin: Dickson-S', 'X-FileName: sdickso.nsf', '', 'Stacey, ', '', ""I'm sure you are aware that MSN stopped providing DSL a few weeks ago because "", 'their wholesale DSL provider, Northpoint filed for bankruptcy.

Subject: Re: Electronic Scheduling  

The individual RTOs have the upper hand as far as dictating what the 
scheduling practices will be.  This is driven by the fact that the RTO 
efforts have focused on the scheduling needs internal to their borders.   The 
problem the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) faces is trying to 
define standard business practices for OASIS II now - after most RTOs have 
taken great steps to defining their own internal scheduling practices.   In 
the West, there is a coordination effort to address the seams between the 3 
RTOs (there are some in theEast as well).   

FERC required in Order 2000, under Function 8, for RTOs to address seams 
issues.   At the ESC workshop last week, several RTOs admitted that Function 
8 is lowest on their list of priorities.  Several, includig a rep from the 
West admitted that the real hard seams issues, those that cannot be patched, 
will likely need FERC involvement to ""force"" a compromise or settlement.   
The problem is that FERC is taking a light handed approach to the seams 
problems with acting Chairman Hebert opting to rely on the RTOs themselves to 
address the seams issues.   Our argument, of course, is that these are the 
entities that have the least incentive to patch the seams.
 
So, by August, the ESC intends to file at FERC the disposition of 26 
scheduling practices - whether there is a single standard for each practice, 
or exactly which ones cannot be agreed upon to be standard (e.g. - losses, 
ramp rates).  My supsicion is that there will be very little commonality ( 
for example - I am leading a group defining Congestion Management practices 
that will likely find very little common practice due to the diversity of 
congestion management approaches in the East) and that the filing will merely 
point out that several scheduling practices need to remain inconsistent at 
the borders -for reliability reasons internal to each RTO.   The threat to us 
is that in order to schedule between RTOs, it may require some ""lowest common 
denominator"" approach that burdens one market with the ineffeciencies of 
another.

If there are any pressing scheduling inconsistencies you see coming that will 
impede markets in the West due to the formation of RTOs, please express those 
to me as I am a bit removed from the activities of the West.  Enron is party 
to a petition for FERC to hold a technical conference on seams issues to 
highlight the importance to the marketplace to patch the seams.  I do intend 
to continue representing Enron at the ESC and hopefully with some additional 
FERC initiatives, put in place as many common scheduling practices as 
possible.

Hi Charles, 

I was going over the NERC meeting minutes and noticed that you were in 
attendance at the meeting.  I would appreciate it if you would tell me your 
opinion about the process, your views on the Escheduling practice as it is 
shaping up, and if you plan to stay involved in the ESC meetings. You are 
welcome to call or e-mail me at your convenience.

Thank you,

Rick,

I am sending you the presentation that was circulated in Steve's meeting last 
Monday, by Jim. This was initiated in a California Conference call when news 
about prices going down first came to be known. Alan drew the very first cut, 
but then I had subsequently changed it quite a bit after getting feedback 
from Tom Briggs, Alan, Jim Steffes, paul Kaufman, Linda Robertson and others.

A few slides from this presentation were then used by Steve for his Madrid 
visit. Mark  Palmer circulated only the graphs of prices going down to the 
press, after he attended Steve's meeting.

I thought of updating you on the same

Regards
Ban

Hello Kevin,

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.  I was asked to contact you
directly by my friend Abrar Sait, whom with I am sure you are acquainted.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading
exchange.  We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration,
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Broadband Services.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.  I have
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan
(and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed
industry participants, venture capital raising process for 3 Series of
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work, and
currently head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.  Prior
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.  It could be a bit more detailed, but I
prefer to keep it lean as it is easier to read, and I can always talk it
through in detail.

My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within a business
developement role, such as Mergers & Acquisition, Venture Capital, or
liasing between deal structuring and commercial marketers.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.  I appreciate that you are
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see
a fit between what I can offer and what your company is doing.

Best Regards,

Joseph P. Mathew

Steve:  

Lisa Jacobson passed on to me your request for some info on our latest multipollutant proposals.  I have attached several documents for your review.   Because this issue and the Administration's review of ""New Source Review"" (NSR) regulations have been receiving a lot of attention lately, I thought I would provide a brief summary as well.  I also think it would be a good idea to have a meeting with you, Rick and Linda at some point before September to make sure you all understand the proposal and our strategy.

Enron's Multipollutant Proposal

Last year, Enron led formation of the ""Clean Power Group"" coalition, which currently includes NiSource, Trigen, El Paso, and Calpine.  The group developed a proposal on multipollutant regulation for the power generation sector (details attached) and has been working to get the White House, EPA and members of Congress to adopt this approach early on in the formative stages of legislation.  

 We have received strong interest on Capitol Hill from Moderate Republicans (including House Science Chair Sherwood Boehlert, Senate Environment Ranking Member Bob Smith), and Democrats (including Senate Energy Chair Jeff Bingaman and a number of House Center Democrats).

Also EPA has been very receptive to our proposal.  In recent statements, Gov. Whitman has expressed support for key elements of our approach - national cap and trade programs for NOx, SO2 and mercury in exchange for overhauls of Clean Air Act provisions and NSR.   A recent EPA memo outlining their plan contains many elements of our approach.  In addition, as the White House has come under increasing pressure on environmental issues (due to the wake of the Bonn climate change talks, absence of a domestic or international strategy, pressure from Hill Democrats and environmentalists), we have had increasing discussions with advisors about how our proposal could help solve some of their current problems.

The Administration's consideration of New Source Review reform has been another driver behind activity on multipollutant and traction of proposals like ours, but I will cover that subject in a separate memo.

Other Multipollutant Plans

There are really only two leading industry multipollutant proposals on the table - our Clean Power Group's and the ""Clean Energy Group"" plan (Sempra; KeySpan; PSEG; PG&E; Conectiv; Consolidated Edison; Exelon; Northeast Utilities).  Key differences from our plan include:  CEG's plan explicitly supports carbon caps - ours does not; CEG's plan proposes drastic emissions cuts rather than our glideslope approach; and CEG's plan for NSR reform is not as ambitious as ours.

Senate Environment Chair Jim Jeffords also has a multipollutant bill, favored by most environmentalists, but considered more of a ""placeholder"" bill.  Jeffords' bill includes stringent carbon caps, prohibits trading of mercury, and leaves NSR and other Clean Air Act programs intact.   

Jeffords plans to mark up this legislation this fall, at which time our plan and CEG's plan will be given serious consideration.  It is also expected that EPA will come out with its formal proposal in the next few months, so we are working hard to make sure as many elements of our plan as possible are included.

Enron's Strategy

We have structured the Enron/Clean Power Group proposal to address numerous commercial concerns, based on positions we have taken on behalf of commercial groups in advocacy on programs like the NOx SIP call, and based on discussions with commercial groups about problems with Clean Air Act regulation or possible opportunities in structuring new programs.

We are in the process of having more detailed analysis done on impacts of our proposed legislation, but here is an overview from an Enron perspective.  (Note:  multipollutant legislation covers power generation sector only at this point, but could be expanded to industrial, pipeline sources in the future)

Generation Development (ENA and EES):  replaces uncertainty, cost, and delay of NSR, emissions offset programs with emissions trading programs that reward efficiency and new technology.  Provides a level playing field for competition with existing sources, who have used environmental regulation to erect barriers to new entrants.
Emissions Trading Markets (EGM):  replaces patchwork of regional programs (different timelines, different pollutants) with a national cap-and-trade program for each pollutant.  Could provide increased volumes in SO2, NOx markets (more players in system, and more allowances traded nationwide), create new markets (mercury & maybe CO2) and spawn derivative markets (options, forward contracts).
Origination (EES, ENA):  creates more regulatory certainty in NSR which has prevented customers from investing in plant improvements, technologies.
Energy Efficiency and renewables (EES, EWC):  trading program allocates allowances for conservation activities and non-emitting generation sources (to date, most air regulations do not reward renewables or efficiency).
New Technology (ENA, EGM, EES, Xcelerator, Principal Investments):  plan provides incentives to developing new, efficient technologies (power gen, mulit-emissions control) either owned by Enron or under consideration for investment.
Cleaner Fuels (ENA, ETS, EGM):  provides incentives for the use of gas in generation, and for the use of cleaner coal/new coal technologies.  For commodity trading in general, plan would provide greater regulatory certainty about the effects of environmental regulation on power markets.

Just to clarify who's doing what at Enron -- I have take the lead, assisted by Lisa, in working with commercial groups to form Enron's strategy, working with the Coalition to structure our proposal, develop strategy, maintain contact with the EPA and Administration, and perform outreach to environmental and industry groups.  Pat Shortridge has assisted on legislative advocacy (Congress and White House outreach) and political strategy related to our proposal, and has worked with our Coalition to make sure its political activities and strategies are well-focused.

If you have any questions, please call me.  I'll be in touch shortly to see if we can arrange a brief, focused meeting on this topic.

ber 21, 2001     Enron Continues to Implode;  Will the Dynegy Deal Proceed?=
  By Will McNamara Director, Electric Industry Analysis    [News item from =
Reuters] Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) shares fell sharply in opening trade on No=
v. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by ne=
xt week $690 million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. The=
 shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, to just over $7.00 in early morni=
ng trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by=
 percentage change and the second-most active stock on the NYSE. As of earl=
y morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares were priced at $4.85, reportedly=
 their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespea=
re, ""Oh, what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to?"" Wait, I=
 better stop. When speaking about Enron, I am not prepared to finish that s=
entence, at least at this point. Enron has been accused of a lot of things =
over the last few weeks, but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exc=
hange Commission (SEC) investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regard=
ing deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader. Enron =
itself has admitted that its financial records from 1997 through the first =
half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" Nevertheless, perception is reali=
ty and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking=
 a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth. While n=
egative perception continues to cause damage to Enron's stock, perhaps of m=
ore current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality=
. We know Enron has just lowered its third-quarter earnings, faces a stiff =
payment of $690 million (due within a week, in fact) and has cast doubt ove=
r its 4Q earnings potential. The question of the hour is whether these new =
financial hits will represent a ""material adverse change"" in the eyes of Dy=
negy, which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in i=
ts purchase contract. The other question is, what happens to Enron if Dyneg=
y leaves it standing at the altar? A terminated marriage agreement would su=
rely cause further reductions to Enron's already-weak credit standing, and =
it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputa=
tion.   As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing ""fall =
of Enron"" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy's proposed=
 acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the=
 proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at  www.scientech.c=
om/rci << File: http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D987=
 >> ). In the interest of time, let me summarize what is happening at this =
moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9-billio=
n offer ($10 a share) to buy the company, which at the time represented a s=
teal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share lit=
tle more than a year ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapte=
r in the Enron saga. In other words, the company had gone through a tumultu=
ous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but still planned to live happily ever afte=
r as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smaller rival.    The developments just=
 this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nupt=
ials between the two companies. For starters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron su=
bmitted its 10-Q report to the SEC (which was five days late, by the way). =
In the report, Enron dropped what have turned out to be several bombshells.=
 First, Enron disclosed that, due to recent downgrades of its credit rating=
 by agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay of=
f or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes to a third party with which it has a=
 partnership, or face nearly $4 billion in additional payments. Enron also =
has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt. Enron would=
 not disclose who owns the note, but we know that the limited partnership i=
ncludes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazilian natural gas-company that Enron =
had planned to sell to raise about $250 million in cash. Note that just las=
t week, various credit services lowered Enron's senior unsecured debt to on=
e notch above junk status and warned that further downgrades may occur, whi=
ch apparently prompted the call for the debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron =
does not make the $690-million payment by Nov. 27, investors will gain the =
right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for an amount equal to the=
 note payable. Enron is presently scrambling to establish a ""mutually accep=
table"" amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt.=
 Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent payment of $690 million, En=
ron said that any further drop in its credit rating might necessitate furth=
er payments of $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of that figure =
going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.    Also in the new SEC filing=
, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. Enron or=
iginally reported a 3Q loss of $618 million, but has now raised that figure=
 to $664 million. As a minor bright side, Enron did increase reported earni=
ngs for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny to 20 cents a share, attri=
buted to adjustments made after the quarter's end. However, looking forward=
, Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of=
 some of its assets could take a further toll on fourth-quarter earnings. E=
nron also claims that, even still, the numbers contained in the 10-Q report=
 are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Anderse=
n, the company's external auditor. Thus, further revision of the numbers co=
uld take place.    Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question =
about whether or not Enron can pay the $690-million debt obligation. Enron =
apparently has secured an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan C=
hase and Citigroup in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing=
, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the li=
nes of credit and net collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by th=
e belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the $690-million payment i=
f it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC fili=
ng, Enron also intends to sell off $8 billion in non-core businesses that a=
re performing ""below acceptable rates"" and would use the proceeds to pay of=
f debts, although this money would probably not be immediately available.  =
 Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that sho=
uld be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past =
in such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently,=
 this non-disclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addi=
ng too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As ha=
s been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inv=
estigation regarding potential conflict-of-issues involving its former CFO.=
 News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is=
 clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock.     As I s=
aid, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems will c=
ause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends on wh=
o you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron'=
s financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the question. So=
me say that the facts disclosed in the 10-Q report do not dramatically chan=
ge Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition a=
nd that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a knee-jerk response to t=
he media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any potent=
ial impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in=
 from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $690-mill=
ion payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is still =
getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price, an=
d the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combin=
ed company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas an=
d electricity.   In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since =
the purchase agreement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 3=
2.5 percent, which weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition,=
 if Enron follows through with the $690-million payment next week or secure=
s additional financing to front this cost, both options alter the company's=
 financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could b=
e construed as a ""material adverse change.""   Another interesting developme=
nt indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to =
purchase. New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwill=
ing to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the company's cred=
it concerns. Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to =
Enron for next-day delivery. What this means in practical terms is that oth=
er trading companies may be gaining Enron's market share, which could dimin=
ish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in t=
he first place. In addition, Enron's once-stellar energy trading business c=
ould now become reduced or collapse altogether.   Questions have been raise=
d why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financ=
ial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committ=
ed to providing an immediate $1.5-billion asset-backed equity infusion into=
 Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, which will be f=
ollowed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company=
 by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy. However, some traders a=
pparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enron's dimi=
nishing ability to secure power on the open market. Traders claim that Dyne=
gy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron, in a st=
rategy known as ""sleeving."" The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take thi=
s step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to =
go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In addition, Enron shareholders launch=
ed a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger wit=
h Dynegy from happening. The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directo=
rs breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too l=
ow a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives. Enron =
said it will defend its decision in court.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to=
 include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement. The clause reportedly=
 allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occur=
s related to the outcome of the SEC investigation, possible litigation agai=
nst Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnings forecasts. Certainly the l=
atest developments disclosed in Enron's 10-Q filing with the SEC impact the=
 company's balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts, so a case could =
be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition. Clearl=
y, this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over t=
he next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons o=
f its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the once-golden company =
still represents a great deal, or if pursuing the purchase would cause more=
 trouble than it is worth.    An archive list of previous IssueAlert articl=

(NYSE: ENE) shares fell sharply in opening trade on No=', 'v. 20 after the humbled energy giant warned it could be forced to pay by ne=', 'xt week $690 million in debt triggered by a credit downgrade last week. The=', ' shares were down $1.16, or 12.8 percent, to just over $7.00 in early morni=', 'ng trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock was the biggest loser by=', ' percentage change and the second-most active stock on the NYSE. As of earl=', 'y morning trading on Nov. 21, Enron shares were priced at $4.85, reportedly=', ' their lowest level in nearly 10 years.   Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespea=', 're, ""Oh, what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to?"" Wait, I=', ' better stop. When speaking about Enron, I am not prepared to finish that s=', 'entence, at least at this point. Enron has been accused of a lot of things =', 'over the last few weeks, but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exc=', 'hange Commission (SEC) investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regard=', 'ing deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader. Enron =', 'itself has admitted that its financial records from 1997 through the first =', 'half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" Nevertheless, perception is reali=', 'ty and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking=', ' a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth. While n=', ""egative perception continues to cause damage to Enron's stock, perhaps of m="", 'ore current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality=', '. We know Enron has just lowered its third-quarter earnings, faces a stiff =', 'payment of $690 million (due within a week, in fact) and has cast doubt ove=', 'r its 4Q earnings potential. The question of the hour is whether these new =', 'financial hits will represent a ""material adverse change"" in the eyes of Dy=', 'negy, which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in i=', 'ts purchase contract. The other question is, what happens to Enron if Dyneg=', 'y leaves it standing at the altar? A terminated marriage agreement would su=', ""rely cause further reductions to Enron's already-weak credit standing, and ="", 'it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputa=', 'tion.   As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing ""fall =', 'of Enron"" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy\'s proposed=', "" acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the="", ' proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at  www.scientech.c=', 'om/rci << File: http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D987=', ' >> ). In the interest of time, let me summarize what is happening at this =', ""moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9-billio="", 'n offer ($10 a share) to buy the company, which at the time represented a s=', 'teal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share lit=', 'tle more than a year ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapte=', 'r in the Enron saga. In other words, the company had gone through a tumultu=', 'ous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but still planned to live happily ever afte=', 'r as part of Dynegy, Inc., its much-smaller rival.    The developments just=', ' this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nupt=', 'ials between the two companies.

Analysis: To paraphrase Shakespea=re, ""Oh, what a tangled web they weave when first they attempt to?"" Wait, I= better stop. When speaking about Enron, I am not prepared to finish that s=entence, at least at this point. Enron has been accused of a lot of things =over the last few weeks, but at this juncture an ongoing Securities and Exc=hange Commission (SEC) investigation has yet to reach any conclusion regard=ing deceptive financial reporting on the part of the Houston trader. Enron =itself has admitted that its financial records from 1997 through the first =half of 2001 ""should not be relied upon."" Nevertheless, perception is reali=ty and the perception currently in the industry is that Enron is now taking= a fall after getting caught following years of skirting the truth. While n=egative perception continues to cause damage to Enron's stock, perhaps of m=ore current interest are the developments that are more grounded in reality=. We know Enron has just lowered its thirdquarter earnings, faces a stiff =payment of $690 million (due within a week, in fact) and has cast doubt ove=r its 4Q earnings potential. The question of the hour is whether these new =financial hits will represent a ""material adverse change"" in the eyes of Dy=negy, which still aims to buy Enron but wisely included an exit clause in i=ts purchase contract. The other question is, what happens to Enron if Dyneg=y leaves it standing at the altar? A terminated marriage agreement would su=rely cause further reductions to Enron's alreadyweak credit standing, and =it is unknown how the company could recover from another blow to its reputa=tion.   As has been the case since the first of October, the ongoing ""fall =of Enron"" story is changing by the day. For background on Dynegy's proposed= acquisition of Enron, and Enron's financial problems that precipitated the= proposal, please see my 11/12/01 IssueAlert (available at  www.scientech.c=om/rci << File: http://secure.scientech.com/issuealert/article.asp?id=3D987= >> ). In the interest of time, let me summarize what is happening at this =moment. Dynegy rode in as Enron's white knight and plopped down a $9billio=n offer ($10 a share) to buy the company, which at the time represented a s=teal of a price considering that Enron was priced at almost $90 a share lit=tle more than a year ago. To some extent, this seemed like the final chapte=r in the Enron saga. In other words, the company had gone through a tumultu=ous year, hit its ""rock bottom"" but still planned to live happily ever afte=r as part of Dynegy, Inc., its muchsmaller rival.    The developments just= this week amount to a screeching brake that may in fact interrupt the nupt=ials between the two companies. For starters, on Monday (Nov. 19), Enron su=bmitted its 10Q report to the SEC (which was five days late, by the way). =In the report, Enron dropped what have turned out to be several bombshells.= First, Enron disclosed that, due to recent downgrades of its credit rating= by agencies such as Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch, it has to pay of=f or refinance by Nov. 26 debt it owes to a third party with which it has a= partnership, or face nearly $4 billion in additional payments. Enron also =has the option of finding new collateral to guarantee the debt. Enron would= not disclose who owns the note, but we know that the limited partnership i=ncludes holdings in C.E.G. Rio, a Brazilian natural gascompany that Enron =had planned to sell to raise about $250 million in cash. Note that just las=t week, various credit services lowered Enron's senior unsecured debt to on=e notch above junk status and warned that further downgrades may occur, whi=ch apparently prompted the call for the debt payment. Reportedly, if Enron =does not make the $690million payment by Nov. 27, investors will gain the =right to immediately begin liquidating the asset for an amount equal to the= note payable. Enron is presently scrambling to establish a ""mutually accep=table"" amendment with lenders to avoid having to issue payment on the debt.= Along with the acknowledgement of the imminent payment of $690 million, En=ron said that any further drop in its credit rating might necessitate furth=er payments of $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of that figure =going to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.    Also in the new SEC filing=, Enron increased its 3Q 2001 loss by 3 cents a share to 87 cents. Enron or=iginally reported a 3Q loss of $618 million, but has now raised that figure= to $664 million. As a minor bright side, Enron did increase reported earni=ngs for the first nine months of 2001 by a penny to 20 cents a share, attri=buted to adjustments made after the quarter's end. However, looking forward=, Enron warned that continuing credit worries and a decline in the value of= some of its assets could take a further toll on fourthquarter earnings. E=nron also claims that, even still, the numbers contained in the 10Q report= are not necessarily final as they have not been reviewed by Arthur Anderse=n, the company's external auditor. Thus, further revision of the numbers co=uld take place.    Interestingly, there does not seem to be a big question =about whether or not Enron can pay the $690million debt obligation. Enron =apparently has secured an additional $2 billion in loans from J.P. Morgan C=hase and Citigroup in the last week. In fact, within the current SEC filing=, Enron says that is has $1.2 billion of domestic cash consisting of the li=nes of credit and net collections. Thus, some investors are reassured by th=e belief that Enron has the cash on hand to make the $690million payment i=f it is unable to renegotiate terms with lenders. According to the SEC fili=ng, Enron also intends to sell off $8 billion in noncore businesses that a=re performing ""below acceptable rates"" and would use the proceeds to pay of=f debts, although this money would probably not be immediately available.  = Again, however, there is a perception element to this development that sho=uld be noted. Enron has been accused of financing partnerships in the past =in such a way as to keep them off the company's balance sheets. Apparently,= this nondisclosure was done so that Enron could grow quickly without addi=ng too much debt to its own books or diluting the value of its stock. As ha=s been well documented, Enron is already in the midst of an intense SEC inv=estigation regarding potential conflictofissues involving its former CFO.= News about other financial deals that may not have been fully disclosed is= clearly making investors even more nervous about Enron's stock.     As I s=aid, the question of the hour is whether or not Enron's new problems will c=ause Dynegy to reconsider its offer. As usual, the answer all depends on wh=o you ask. Dynegy is remaining mum and referring all questions about Enron'=s financial status to Enron. Investors are rather mixed on the question. So=me say that the facts disclosed in the 10Q report do not dramatically chan=ge Enron's position from what it was when Dynegy launched its acquisition a=nd that the current drop in Enron's stock is just a kneejerk response to t=he media hype surrounding the story. Further, those who diminish any potent=ial impact say that Enron is still a liquid company and has money coming in= from various sources. Thus, it should have no trouble making the $690mill=ion payment. From a broad perspective, so one theory goes, Dynegy is still =getting a great deal in Enron due to its staggering drop in stock price, an=d the acquisition remains valuable to Dynegy as it will position the combin=ed company as North America's biggest marketer and trader of natural gas an=d electricity.   In contrast, other investors point to the fact that since =the purchase agreement was signed, Enron's stock has fallen an additional 3=2.5 percent, which weakens the original acquisition agreement. In addition,= if Enron follows through with the $690million payment next week or secure=s additional financing to front this cost, both options alter the company's= financial position from when Dynegy made its original offer, which could b=e construed as a ""material adverse change.""   Another interesting developme=nt indicates that Enron may no longer be the company that Dynegy agreed to =purchase. New reports indicate many energy trading companies are now unwill=ing to sell power or natural gas to Enron for fear about the company's cred=it concerns. Such companies are now particularly reticent to sell power to =Enron for nextday delivery. What this means in practical terms is that oth=er trading companies may be gaining Enron's market share, which could dimin=ish the value in the trading market that had attracted Dynegy to Enron in t=he first place. In addition, Enron's oncestellar energy trading business c=ould now become reduced or collapse altogether.   Questions have been raise=d why Dynegy is not doing more at this time to help Enron out of its financ=ial mess. Of course, under the acquisition agreement Dynegy already committ=ed to providing an immediate $1.5billion assetbacked equity infusion into= Enron to help the company with its current financial woes, which will be f=ollowed by an additional infusion of $2.5 billion into the combined company= by ChevronTexaco, which owns 27 percent of Dynegy. However, some traders a=pparently have wondered why Dynegy has not done anything about Enron's dimi=nishing ability to secure power on the open market. Traders claim that Dyne=gy could step in and buy power from sellers on the behalf of Enron, in a st=rategy known as ""sleeving."" The fact that Dynegy has not chosen to take thi=s step has been an indication to some observers that it is only willing to =go so far in its pursuit of Enron.   In addition, Enron shareholders launch=ed a lawsuit on Nov. 12 in state court in Houston to prevent the merger wit=h Dynegy from happening. The petition reportedly alleges that Enron directo=rs breached their fiduciary duties by agreeing to sell the company at too l=ow a price and without adequate consideration of other alternatives. Enron =said it will defend its decision in court.    Moreover, Dynegy was smart to= include an exit clause in the acquisition agreement. The clause reportedly= allows Dynegy to walk away from Enron if any material adverse change occur=s related to the outcome of the SEC investigation, possible litigation agai=nst Enron, balance sheet strengths, and earnings forecasts. Certainly the l=atest developments disclosed in Enron's 10Q filing with the SEC impact the= company's balance sheet strengths and earnings forecasts, so a case could =be made that Dynegy would have grounds to terminate the acquisition. Clearl=y, this pending deal hinges on the developments that will take place over t=he next few weeks. Dynegy ultimately will have to weigh the pros and cons o=f its acquisition offer for Enron and determine if the oncegolden company =still represents a great deal, or if pursuing the purchase would cause more= trouble than it is worth.

 Why San Diego, Where Rates First Rose, No Longer Conserves Energy
 By LAURA M. HOLSON
   
 01/30/2001 
 The New York Times 
 Page 20, Column 1 
 c. 2001 New York Times Company 

 SAN DIEGO, Jan. 25 -- It was here, in the heat of last summer, that 
consumers got their initial lesson in how painful California's
 experiment with deregulation could be.

 With electricity supplies short and the state's power grid on the brink of 
collapse, wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled, and the San
 Diego Gas and Electric Company, the first utility in the state freed by 
deregulation, passed those costs on to its customers. Homeowners
 took to the streets, and businesses threatened to leave the city, 
California's second largest.

 Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers, having felt the price shock 
that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from, would
 be wiser about using electricity than other Californians. But the price 
shock was too short.

 In September, California legislators called off the experiment, capping 
retail electrical rates at 6.5 cents a kilowatt hour, the average market
 price paid in the month before the summer crisis.

 Now, six months later, San Diegans are back to their old ways.

 Electricity use, which dropped 9 percent in August, is back up to precrisis 
levels, according to San Diego Gas and Electric. Rather than
 investing in insulation or energy-efficient air-conditioners, consumers here 
seem to be hovering between denial and defiance.

 ''I feel I do all that I can to conserve,'' said Vicki Barber, an escrow 
coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego. ''But I'm not going
 to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesn't matter anyway.''

 As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity 
skyrockets, San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted
 when consumers here revolted last summer, demanding relief.

 In September, when California legislators restored the lower rates, 
residential and small-business rate payers received credits on their utility
 bills -- even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is 
expected to come due as soon as 2002. And it is true that the utility's
 largest customers are already paying market rates.

 Still, Jeannie Thompson's reaction was typical. In August, Ms. Thompson, the 
branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in
 the Pacific Beach district, made it her business to turn off office lights 
and computers every night. ''When the news first came out, you
 wanted to do your part,'' she said.

 Then, in October, the office got its credit, and ''we started to go back to 
the way things were before.''

 Economists look at San Diegans' behavior and draw this lesson: Consumers 
must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and
 conveniences they have grown used to.

 ''Summer should have been a wake-up call,'' said Peter Navarro, associate 
professor of economics and public policy at the University of
 California at Irvine. ''You can't blame San Diego consumers for not doing 
anything, because legislators stepped in and lowered prices. If
 the discomfort isn't of a lengthy duration, the adjustments to behavior that 
need to take place won't.''

 Indeed, in a recent paper, a group of energy experts and economists, 
including two Nobel Prize winners, made the same point, saying that
 if consumers knew the true cost of electricity, they would conserve more.

 Even Gov. Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates 
would not rise.

 But San Diego consumers, once again insulated from rate increases, have 
shrugged off the crisis, in part because they have taken to heart
 the governor's oft-repeated claim that the problems are the fault of 
out-of-state power generators that need to be reined in.

 ''Ask these people if they feel safe at night,'' Pete Phelps said wryly of 
those generators. Mr. Phelps, an airline pilot, was, with his wife, Pat,
 loading a 50-gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home 
Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena.

 Mrs. Phelps added, ''You don't know what is legitimate, who to believe.''

 So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve, except 
turning off lights, as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to $130,
 from about $85, in the past two years. Their new water heater was billed as 
''energy efficient,'' and while it should save them $150 a year,
 they did not buy it with conservation in mind. ''I spill that in beer 
money,'' Mr. Phelps said.

 High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior, Mr. Navarro, the 
economist, said. If consumers, for instance, believe that turning off
 lights benefits someone other than themselves, they will feel no incentive 
to conserve. That, he said, is the situation in the Pacific Northwest,
 where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be 
diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs.

 But in San Diego, people have gotten a particularly mixed message. To begin 
with, high rates did not last long enough to make an impact.
 Rather, the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to 
protect consumers at any cost.

 The math, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute, was simple.

 ''If you go from 6 cents to 22 cents to 6 cents, then the response will be 
to weather the storm,'' Mr. Borenstein said, referring to the price
 of a kilowatt hour. ''But if it stays at 22 cents, then it makes sense for 
people to go out and invest in ways to save energy.''

 Mr. Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the 1970's. At 
first, he said, motorists demonized Middle East oil producers, as
 lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations, waiting for rationed 
supplies. Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change
 their habits, buying more fuel-efficient cars, he said.

 Still, some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in.

 ''I have not put the heat on,'' said Ms. Thompson, the real estate agent. 
''I close my doors and put on a sweater.''

 But she has not had an energy audit of her home, a service provided by San 
Diego Gas and Electric, or bought energy-saving appliances.

 During last summer's price spike, surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric 
found that 91 percent of its 1.2 million users did not think the
 utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis, said Stephen L. 
Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the utility's parent company.
 And there is bound to be more anger, now that the utility has requested a 
surcharge of about 16 percent in March, to pay off $450 million it
 owes its power suppliers.

 Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by. 
At a recent outdoor farmer's market in El Cajon, a working-class
 town 15 miles east of San Diego, Heidi Van Horn, a massage therapist, and 
her fiance, Bernie Herloss, a handyman, were supplementing
 their $1,200 monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to 
hungry shoppers.

 For the two-bedroom apartment they share, the couple have $200 in past-due 
energy bills. Those bills hover at about $100 a month, up
 from $55 two years ago. ''We aren't one of these high-rollers who make $9 an 
hour,'' Ms. Van Horn said. ''We either pay the electricity or
 have the phone shut off.''

 Even so, she said, they do what they can to conserve, turning down the 
thermostat or turning off the occasional light. But their apartment
 building is poorly insulated. Cold wind seeps in through closed windows, and 
the heating vents are near the ceiling, where the warmth is
 wasted. Their only energy-efficient light bulb is the one that came in the 
mail from San Diego Gas and Electric.

 And the two birds and the iguana they keep, Ms. Van Horn said, would die if 
she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run
 continuously in the apartment.

 She would never consider getting rid of the pets. Ms. Van Horn said. ''They 
are family.''

HOLSON    01/30/2001  The New York Times  Page 20, Column 1  c. 2001 New York Times Company  SAN DIEGO, Jan. 25  It was here, in the heat of last summer, that consumers got their initial lesson in how painful California's experiment with deregulation could be. With electricity supplies short and the state's power grid on the brink of collapse, wholesale electricity costs nearly tripled, and the San Diego Gas and Electric Company, the first utility in the state freed by deregulation, passed those costs on to its customers. Homeowners took to the streets, and businesses threatened to leave the city, California's second largest. Logic would suggest that San Diego consumers, having felt the price shock that the rest of the state so far had been shielded from, would be wiser about using electricity than other Californians. But the price shock was too short. In September, California legislators called off the experiment, capping retail electrical rates at 6.5 cents a kilowatt hour, the average market price paid in the month before the summer crisis. Now, six months later, San Diegans are back to their old ways. Electricity use, which dropped 9 percent in August, is back up to precrisis levels, according to San Diego Gas and Electric. Rather than investing in insulation or energyefficient airconditioners, consumers here seem to be hovering between denial and defiance. ''I feel I do all that I can to conserve,'' said Vicki Barber, an escrow coordinator for a real estate broker in San Diego. ''But I'm not going to spend all this money upgrading my house when it doesn't matter anyway.'' As a test laboratory of consumer behavior when the cost of a necessity skyrockets, San Diego seems confused by how politicians reacted when consumers here revolted last summer, demanding relief. In September, when California legislators restored the lower rates, residential and smallbusiness rate payers received credits on their utility bills  even though the credits are really a postponed debt that is expected to come due as soon as 2002. And it is true that the utility's largest customers are already paying market rates. Still, Jeannie Thompson's reaction was typical. In August, Ms. Thompson, the branch manager of a Coldwell Banker real estate office in the Pacific Beach district, made it her business to turn off office lights and computers every night. ''When the news first came out, you wanted to do your part,'' she said. Then, in October, the office got its credit, and ''we started to go back to the way things were before.'' Economists look at San Diegans' behavior and draw this lesson: Consumers must suffer a lot before they willingly give up comfort and conveniences they have grown used to. ''Summer should have been a wakeup call,'' said Peter Navarro, associate professor of economics and public policy at the University of California at Irvine. ''You can't blame San Diego consumers for not doing anything, because legislators stepped in and lowered prices. If the discomfort isn't of a lengthy duration, the adjustments to behavior that need to take place won't.'' Indeed, in a recent paper, a group of energy experts and economists, including two Nobel Prize winners, made the same point, saying that if consumers knew the true cost of electricity, they would conserve more. Even Gov. Gray Davis seems to be backing away from his promise that rates would not rise. But San Diego consumers, once again insulated from rate increases, have shrugged off the crisis, in part because they have taken to heart the governor's oftrepeated claim that the problems are the fault of outofstate power generators that need to be reined in. ''Ask these people if they feel safe at night,'' Pete Phelps said wryly of those generators. Mr. Phelps, an airline pilot, was, with his wife, Pat, loading a 50gallon water heater into the back of his pickup truck at a Home Depot near the San Diego Sports Arena. Mrs. Phelps added, ''You don't know what is legitimate, who to believe.'' So the Phelpses have done little in recent months to conserve, except turning off lights, as their monthly electricity bill has climbed to $130, from about $85, in the past two years. Their new water heater was billed as ''energy efficient,'' and while it should save them $150 a year, they did not buy it with conservation in mind. ''I spill that in beer money,'' Mr. Phelps said. High prices alone cannot change consumer behavior, Mr. Navarro, the economist, said. If consumers, for instance, believe that turning off lights benefits someone other than themselves, they will feel no incentive to conserve. That, he said, is the situation in the Pacific Northwest, where many residents believe that any power they save will simply be diverted to hot tubs in the San Francisco suburbs. But in San Diego, people have gotten a particularly mixed message. To begin with, high rates did not last long enough to make an impact. Rather, the lingering impression was that legislators would step in to protect consumers at any cost. The math, said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute, was simple. ''If you go from 6 cents to 22 cents to 6 cents, then the response will be to weather the storm,'' Mr. Borenstein said, referring to the price of a kilowatt hour. ''But if it stays at 22 cents, then it makes sense for people to go out and invest in ways to save energy.'' Mr. Borenstein drew a parallel to the gasoline shortages of the 1970's. At first, he said, motorists demonized Middle East oil producers, as lines of cars snaked around gasoline stations, waiting for rationed supplies. Only after high prices persisted did consumers begin to change their habits, buying more fuelefficient cars, he said. Still, some San Diegans insist that they are pitching in. ''I have not put the heat on,'' said Ms. Thompson, the real estate agent. ''I close my doors and put on a sweater.'' But she has not had an energy audit of her home, a service provided by San Diego Gas and Electric, or bought energysaving appliances. During last summer's price spike, surveys by San Diego Gas and Electric found that 91 percent of its 1.2 million users did not think the utility was being wholly honest with them about the crisis, said Stephen L. Baum, chairman of Sempra Energy, the utility's parent company. And there is bound to be more anger, now that the utility has requested a surcharge of about 16 percent in March, to pay off $450 million it owes its power suppliers. Higher rates will also make life harder for people who are just getting by. At a recent outdoor farmer's market in El Cajon, a workingclass town 15 miles east of San Diego, Heidi Van Horn, a massage therapist, and her fiance, Bernie Herloss, a handyman, were supplementing their $1,200 monthly income by selling grilled bratwurst and hamburgers to hungry shoppers. For the twobedroom apartment they share, the couple have $200 in pastdue energy bills. Those bills hover at about $100 a month, up from $55 two years ago. ''We aren't one of these highrollers who make $9 an hour,'' Ms. Van Horn said. ''We either pay the electricity or have the phone shut off.'' Even so, she said, they do what they can to conserve, turning down the thermostat or turning off the occasional light. But their apartment building is poorly insulated. Cold wind seeps in through closed windows, and the heating vents are near the ceiling, where the warmth is wasted. Their only energyefficient light bulb is the one that came in the mail from San Diego Gas and Electric. And the two birds and the iguana they keep, Ms. Van Horn said, would die if she turned off any of the three heat lamps that run continuously in the apartment. She would never consider getting rid of the pets. Ms. Van Horn said. ''They are family.''

Stephanie,

I am following up on the above-referenced Agreement on behalf of Richard
Weiss of this office. Before we can send the execution copies to our Zurich
office for signature, we have to obtain an Apostille for the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws which you provided. Presently we are waiting on
that. The Guarantee has been prepared and the legal opinion is in the
process of being signed. I hope to have everything to you by next week
sometime.

Please feel free to reply with any questions you might have.

Thank you,
Kimberly

Dear Elizabeth---Just wanted you to know I truly enjoyed meeting you today.
Thank you for taking the time to learn more about my background and to share
your Enron experience with me.  On reflection, I still think Enron is more of
a financial company than a tech company - tech/broadband is just one of
Enron's many facets.  A few years ago I think Enron was having trouble
deciding whether it was an energy company or a financial company - and
settled on the latter to chart its direction.  I think Enron's innovative
processes and approaches to problem solving are what make the prospect of
working with you so exciting.  I am most interested in the available
opportunity and look forward to hearing from you soon,

I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel.

BODY:

???Senior executives at Southern California Edison and its parent company went
without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in 2000 because of
California's power crisis.

??Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid
$950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 
1999.

??Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California
Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling 
$1.3
million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

??The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to
executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis.

??In a similar statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric Corp.
revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they 
did
receive raises.

??Edison and PG&E say they have lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from
regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 
6.

??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its

HEADLINE: Energy officials accused of manipulating natural gas market defend
actions

BYLINE: By Andres LaMar

BODY:

??SACRAMENTO _ Energy officials who are accused of manipulating California's
market for natural gas defended their actions on Thursday and attributed the
state's skyrocketing gas prices to increased demand, the weather and other
factors.

??The explanation, however, drew skepticism from lawmakers in the wake of
expert testimony alleging that one Texas firm, El Paso Natural Gas Co., had
engineered a classic case of monopoly power by controlling the pipeline that
delivers gas to the state.

??At the outset of the Thursday's hearing, Assemblyman Darrell Steinberg,
D-Sacramento, noted the huge run-up in the cost of natural gas, which went 
from
$6.6 billion for the entire year of 1999 to $12.3 billion for sales in 2000 
and
to $7.9 billion for the first three months of this year.

??Steinberg zeroed in on the difference between California and other parts of
the country. From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 
489
percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent 
jump
in Chicago.

??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co.
subsidiary, for an explanation.

??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to 
constraints
on the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked.

??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led power
plants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gas
over the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than 
the
year before exacerbated the problem.

??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officials
said they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E's
movement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the 
Public
Utilities Commission.

??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on the
federal government to re- regulate natural gas sales at the California border
and U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., said federal regulators should impose
price caps on California's wholesale electricity market.

??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking for
re-regulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing 
nothing
to come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration.

??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the world
started after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" said
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino.

A U-TURN ON CAR TAX REBATES;

LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTO
VEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL.

BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER



DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:


??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a U-turn Thursday and scrapped a
costly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then 
get a
rebate in the mail.

??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners of
approximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced 
by
the amount of the vehicle license fee rebates.

??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davis
an ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governor
had previously fought for and defended.

??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% the
amount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers and
former Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. It
had been about 2% of a vehicle's market value.

??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will
""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs.""

??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of the
rebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact that
they're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands.""

??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting the
car tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, which
Davis felt would have a greater impact.

??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002,
when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to have
fallen permanently, with no more rebates.

??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorial
election cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks), who supported
reductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates.

??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount of
their license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year.

??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reduction
of 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals on
July 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut.

??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system 
.
. . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and 
then
await a rebate check from the state--a system that is, at best, difficult to
explain.""

??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrank
and taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy 
electricity, 
the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassment
to Davis.

??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone were
estimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year.

??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) and McClintock sought to
eliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they register
their vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed.

??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,""
McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk.""

??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it as
the lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (D-Arcata) 
was
substituted.

??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine) suggested that Davis'
performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would 
have
resulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers.""

??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent to
Davis by the Senate on a 34-0 vote Thursday.

??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in order
to take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because 
motorists
must be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due.

??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mail
them by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said. ""It will be a little tight,
but we will still make it.""

??Branch said that since the Jan. 1 start of rebates, checks totaling $ 454
million have been sent to 7.4 million vehicle owners at an extra 
administrative
cost of $ 9.4 million.

LOCKYER ASKS JUDGE TO ORDER FIRMS TO RELEASE RECORDS

BYLINE: ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS



BODY:


??California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, ratcheting up his investigation of
possible civil and criminal violations by the state's power suppliers, is 
asking
a San Francisco judge to order two firms to hand over confidential records.

??In a motion filed Thursday in Superior Court, Lockyer said Reliant Energy 
and
Mirant Corp. have failed to comply with subpoenas for documents that were to 
be
produced by March 19.

??Amid soaring electricity costs and rolling blackouts, the attorney general
launched an investigation of possible manipulation of wholesale electricity
prices that have skyrocketed to record levels and have financially crippled 
the
state's major utilities.

??Dozens of other public and private power suppliers are complying with the
subpoenas.

??But in an interview, Lockyer accused Reliant and Mirant of stonewalling
investigators ""so they can keep enjoying these exorbitant profits and prices 
for
as long as possible.""

??Ultimately, the companies will have to honor the subpoenas, he said. ""I'm
going to pit bull them,"" he said. ""This is one we win.""

??Both companies say they have done nothing wrong and played by the rules of
California's flawed electricity deregulation plan.

??A spokesman for Houston-based Reliant said Thursday the firm is seeking 
court
action of its own to ensure that sensitive business information will not be
shared with other public agencies or its competitors.

??Last week, Reliant asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to clarify the
attorney general's obligation to keep proprietary information confidential.

??""We're glad to cooperate with his investigation to the extent we can,"" said
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley. "" But we have not received sufficient
assurances that Lockyer would keep the data confidential.""

??Lockyer called Reliant's court filing ""frivolous"" and ""propagandistic"" and
insisted that adequate safeguards are in place. He reserves the right under
state law to share information with other government agencies aiding in his
investigation but has said he will keep sensitive business information from
being made public.

??Atlanta-based Mirant demanded and received similar guarantees of
confidentiality, Lockyer said. Mirant did not return phones calls Thursday.

??Lockyer did not discuss details of the probe or the kinds of information 
he's
seeking. But based on the investigation so far, he said, ""it's beginning to 
get
interesting.""

??Other records indicate that the attorney general has sought 91 categories of
information about the power merchants' activities. They include the operation 
of
power plants, trading information that may have been shared by private power
suppliers and bidding strategies in the California market.

LEGISLATORS UNITE OVER ENERGY PRICE ISSUE;
?POWER: BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION CALLED TOGETHER BY DAVIS SAYS U. 
S.
MUST STEP IN TO PROTECT STATE FROM MANIPULATION BY SUPPLIERS.

BYLINE: MITCHELL LANDSBERG and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS



BODY:


??This may be the surest sign yet of the depth of California's energy crisis: 
A
bipartisan cross-section of the state's congressional delegation, brought
together Thursday by Gov. Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of 
the
problem but also about the need for swift federal intervention.

??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,""
Rep. Darrell E. Issa (R-Vista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at 
the
meeting near Los Angeles International airport.

??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission must
slash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again 
afford
to buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity 
on
their behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many power
suppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection.

??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is strongly
opposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, California
Republicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that the
administration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushed
aside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideological
belief in a free market.

??""This is not a free-enterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Alpine) 
said
after the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite.""

??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged to
California and those charged in other Western states, he said California 
clearly
has been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, the
FERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting 
""market
power"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.

??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators in
Sacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices in
California to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipeline
into the state.

??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman
(D-Sherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats 
and
Republicans appeared to be their relative faith--or lack thereof--in the 
ability
of President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been 
much
speculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political 
motive
to help the state.

??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is proven
wrong.""

??Davis--who sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and the
governor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freeman--said he 
used
the meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californians
this summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. Five
Republicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.

??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with 
Bush
to discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editors
Wednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney in
which, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance.

??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying 
they
appear to have constricted access to a California-bound pipeline to run up
prices.

??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before an
Assembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had 
manipulated
the market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity that
they had, in effect, withheld access to it.

??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to deliver
gas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and 
causing
a surge in prices.

??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soared
in California because generators that use gas to make electricity increased
production last year in response to the energy crisis.

??""We're not withholding capacity--no one is,"" said El Paso Merchant Energy
President Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.""

??In other developments Thursday:

??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailing
utility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected by
legislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note to
clients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would 
be
a humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said.

??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison's
transmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion 
in
bonds--both designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edison
agreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state 
at
prices tied to the cost of producing power.

??Since they returned Monday from a two-week recess, state legislators have
been sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire to
tinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that a
bankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such a
dire outcome.

??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up on
passage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.

??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highly
detailed 38-page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That 
is
appropriate.""

??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternative
energy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies from
PG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.

??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuits
some providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with the
cash-starved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energy
account for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.

??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hot
days of summer,"" Wood said.

??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs to
address the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten is
rhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said.

??* An $ 850-million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious 
megawatts
appears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by state
officials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.

??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242
million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute to
the state's investor-owned utilities to support existing conservation 
programs.

??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, said
Thursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protection
April 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.

??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E's
decision--coupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could 
follow a
similar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Court--has complicated her agency's efforts.

??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition the
Bankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust and
separated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if the
court denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expenses
anyway. The process, she added, could take about a month--too long in the view
of some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late 
spring
and early summer.

??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said his
agency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster their
output during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase the
necessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full 
for
earlier electricity deliveries.

??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall,
""but every little bit helps.""

HEADLINE: Federal energy commission considers price fix for state energy 
market

BYLINE: By Dena Bunis

BODY:

??WASHINGTON _ Californians who see federal re-regulation of the state's
crisis-bound energy market as an answer to the impending summer emergency 
better
look for some other solution.

??Even the short-term price fix that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
may consider at its Wednesday meeting might be too little too late.

??Lobbyists, lawmakers and other FERC-watchers say they have seen a slight
shift in recent weeks among commission staff and at least one member. There is
some willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though the
Bush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.

??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies on
FERC will provide a margin for change.

??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are 
best
is not likely to change soon, members say.

??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards for
determining market-based rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. 
But
with no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on this
market-based pricing.""

??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turns
down requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have 
been
given that authority, he said.

??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, 
it
must show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate the
market and drive prices up.

??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants and
lawyers,"" Massey said.

??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed to
the commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should 
trigger
cost-based rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place 
for
one year, under the staff proposal.

??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It has
to make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now 
on.

??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, 
is
that during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity to
manipulate the market and drive prices up.

??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, says
Les Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatory
affairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts 
associated
with that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators 
from
jacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.

??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to take
effect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation.

??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathitt
said Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls,
said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in California
she was open to considering some short-term measures.

??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but said
she wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday.

??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while the
power sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filings
are handled.

??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be
""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going 
to
be in a Stage 3 emergency.""

??Feinstein, D-Calif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC to
step in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergency
period.

??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" said
Roger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a 
real
stability problem when you cut it that close.""

??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners,
particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe will
replace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate.

??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman,
Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Wood
would take as chairman.

??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,""
Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personal
discussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.""

??But once again, timing could be a problem.

??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of the
Pennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate.

??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now,
and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinstein
said. ""Please please please, President Bush, process your nominees.""

HEADLINE: In response to power woes, rating agencies have California on credit
watch

BYLINE: By Jennifer Bjorhus

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ All three of the nation's influential judges of credit
risk now have California on credit watch, saying they are deeply concerned 
about
the economic impact of the state's power crisis.

??The Fitch credit rating agency made it unanimous Wednesday when it warned
that the thickening electricity quagmire, as well as lower than expected tax
revenues in February and March, could spell broader risk for the state's 
budget.

??The announcement is a signal that Fitch, too, may downgrade its ratings on
California's nearly $30 billion in public debt, a move which could cost
taxpayers millions.

??The announcement comes as state lawmakers mull a bailout plan for Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. sits in bankruptcy and state
officials bleed through the state's general fund as they purchase expensive
electricity for consumers. Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that 
the
average daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a 
day
in the last week of March, to $73 million a day.

??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their 
own
credit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded 
the
state's very good double-A credit rating.

??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to 
price
municipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offer
bondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.

??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.

??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook from
stable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for
bankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at 
negative
since January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities.

??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was 
the
disagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will be
spent.

??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that money
generated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the state
Department of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for the
utilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paid
first, there won't be any money left for it.

??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatens
to hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department of
Water Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.

??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said.
""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.""

??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes as
expected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were below
forecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those 
months
fell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected.

??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costs
now exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California 
analyst
for Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern.

??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of these
projected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what the
current economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some of
the problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investors
last week in a conference call.

??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't be
reached for comment. Other economy-watchers expressed concern.

??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said the
move reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon.

??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and does
remain very strong,"" he said.

HEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually pay

BYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael Bazeley

BODY:

??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rate
increase that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit 
bills
beginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.

??Now, much of that is up in the air.

??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June. Exactly which 
consumers
and businesses will pay how much is uncertain as regulators rush to forge a 
rate
structure from a tangle of more than 20 proposals.

??Their task has been complicated immeasurably by Gov. Gray Davis' decision to
weigh in with a competing rate plan and Pacific Gas & Electric's move into
bankruptcy court.

??""Little details are moving billions of dollars around,"" said Nettie Hoge of
consumer advocate group TURN.

??All the proposals assume a ""tiered"" structure that forces the heaviest users
of energy to pay the most. But key details yet to be decided mean consumers
could see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent or
more.

??Among them:

??_How much of an overall increase? The Public Utilities Commission approved a
3-cent per kilowatt hour increase last month, which would boost utility 
revenue
$4.8 million. Gov. Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 television
address _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for 
customers
of Southern California Edison.

??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise rates
only for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis 
would
include the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.

??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from the
new rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more 
than
any of the average increase figures being tossed about.

??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase? At the
time of the PUC vote on March 27, commissioner said their increase would take
effect immediately.

??Various plans are being presented this week to an administrative law judge
working for the commission. The judge is expected to recommend a rate 
structure
to the PUC on May 4. Public hearings would follow May 7-11, and the commission
would vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normally
lasts nearly a year.

??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residential
customers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt from
higher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buy
power. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which 
is
the average basic level of use for each region of the state.

??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates 
for
""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 
percent
of that level.

??But that's where the similarities end.

??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of an
assumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because 
they
don't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,
commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.

??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens to
everyone else?

??Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&E
users would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see bills
increase 36 percent.

??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percent
while heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill 
increase
for PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20
percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement 
on
the governor's web site.

??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30
percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.

??The most consumer-friendly of the various proposals comes from
consumer-rights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential 
increase
of just 7.5 percent.

??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make up
for the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.

??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residential
users to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higher
rates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average 
rate
hike of nearly 30 percent.

??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" said
Matthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.

??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill for
electricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.

??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.
Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge that
everyone would pay, regardless of how much they use.

??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period of
time _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting a
smaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.

??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, the
commission's director of energy issues.

??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:
California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover the
wholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent per
kilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be 
far
from enough.

??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3-cent increase. But Davis
followed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed for
bankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higher
rates.

??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis'
proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointed
three of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined 
to
show him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan,
which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.

HEADLINE: Edison pushes lawmakers to accept deal

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
Although lawmakers are skeptical of the state's multibillion-dollar deal to
acquire the power lines of Southern California Edison, the head of the 
utility's
parent company warned yesterday that failure to approve the accord could lead 
to
a ""long and costly"" bankruptcy.

???But John Bryson, chief executive of Edison International, told The 
Chronicle
that he thought legislators would ""want to do the right thing"" by approving 
the
multibillion-dollar agreement and preventing Edison from following Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court.

???Bankruptcy for California's two largest utilities could have severe
consequences for consumers. Financial analysts said a worsening of the state's
energy mess would increase the possibility of higher electricity rates.

???Nevertheless, lawmakers are unlikely to accept the Edison deal -- at least
not in its present form.

???""We are going to go through this thing extensively,"" said state Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco. ""There are a lot of concerns
about the valuation.""

???Still, he said, legislative backing for the accord remains possible as long
as Edison is open to amending some of the terms.

???""The Edison people are smart enough to know that the Legislature is going 
to
have its say,"" Burton said.

???Indeed, sources familiar with the matter said Edison expected a certain
amount of tinkering with the deal and would not resist efforts to reach common
ground with lawmakers.

???""The Assembly members do not view bankruptcy as a favorable alternative,""
said Assemblyman Herb Wesson, D-Los Angeles. ""There will be a big effort to 
try
and work something out.""

???Edison's Bryson seems eager at this point to present himself and his 
company
as reasonable business partners who are willing to negotiate in good faith.

???This contrasts sharply with the state's relations with PG&E, which turned
acrimonious after PG&E blindsided the governor with its bankruptcy filing. 
Each
side blamed the other for the collapse of earlier negotiations.

???""We made the decision at an early stage that this was a massive problem for
the state and that the best course was to find a practical solution that would
allow us to get on with operating our power system,"" Bryson said.

???Bankruptcy, he said, ""is absolutely a last resort. It's a long and costly
process.""

???It is also the last thing Wall Street wants to see. On Wednesday, rating
agency Fitch Inc. joined Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investor Service in
warning that California's credit rating could be lowered because of the 
state's
energy mess.

???""The state may be forced to issue junk bonds,"" said Carol Coale, an
energy-industry analyst at Prudential Securities in New York. ""This could lead
to a surcharge on electricity bills to guarantee the bonds.""

???Bryson, not surprisingly, defended Edison's agreement with the governor as 
a
prudent alternative to bankruptcy.

???""This is a very good deal for the state,"" he said. ""It is not a bailout.
Edison gives up a lot to make all this possible.""

???Southern California Edison will sell its power lines to the state for $2.8
billion. It also will provide low-cost power to California for 10 years and 
drop
a federal lawsuit seeking full recovery of nearly $5 billion in past debt.

???Critics say the state is paying far too much for Edison's transmission
system -- more than two times book value -- and that the power lines are of
little use unless PG&E's grid also can be acquired.

???""It's a multibillion-dollar ratepayer bailout of Edison,"" said Doug Heller,
a spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa 
Monica.
""Edison gets off scot-free.""

???Under the most likely scenario, lawmakers will seek to reduce the amount
paid for Edison's power lines and to increase the role of the California 
Public
Utilities Commission in regulating the utility.

???They also will try to come up with a workable contingency plan for the 
state
if PG&E remains adamant in its refusal to sell off its part of the power grid.

???""The deal on the table is still salvageable,"" said Michael Shames, 
executive
director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego. ""But Edison
needs to understand that what it got from the governor is only a framework, 
not
set in stone.""

???For his part, Bryson signaled that plenty of room existed for give and take
on the issue.

???""We're just at the initial stage,"" he said. ""We always have accepted the
notion that Edison is a California regulated utility and is subject to the 
laws
of the Public Utilities Commission.""E-mail David Lazarus at

HEADLINE: Most Edison executives going without bonuses

BYLINE: By GARY GENTILE, AP Business Writer

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:

??Senior executives at Edison International and its subsidiary, Southern
California Edison, went without hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses in
2000 because of California's power crisis.

??Edison International's chairman and chief executive, John Bryson, was paid $
950,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling $2.16 million in 
1999.

??Stephen Frank, the chairman and chief executive at Southern California
Edison, was paid $617,000 in 2000, compared with salary and bonus totaling 
$1.3
million in 1999, according to the company's proxy statement filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

??The company also said Thursday it would not award merit increases to
executives in 2001 because of the continuing crisis.

??In a similar proxy statement released Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric 
Corp.
revealed it also withheld bonuses for its top two executives, although they 
did
receive raises.

??Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices that the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from
regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 
6.

??Edison is continuing to work with state officials and its creditors.

??The utility said its board of directors decided to withhold bonuses to all
but two key executives because the financial effects of the energy crisis have
overshadowed all other aspects of company and individual performance.

??The two executives who did get bonuses earned them for their roles in
preserving the viability of the companies during the crisis and for retention
purposes, Edison said.

??Ted Craver, senior vice president, chief financial officer and treasurer at
Edison International, was paid $375,000 in 2000 and received a $100,000 bonus.
His total compensation in 1999 was $652,100.

??Harold Ray, executive vice president at Southern California Edison, received
a salary of $390,000 in 2000 and a bonus of $50,000. His cash compensation in
1999 was $818,400.

??PG&E paid Chairman Robert D. Glynn Jr. $945,086 in salary and benefits 
during
2000, a 58 percent decrease from $2.26 million in the prior year, according to
the company's proxy statement.

??Glynn, 57, received a 12.5 percent increase in his base salary but didn't 
get
a bonus.

??Gordon R. Smith, who runs Pacific Gas and Electric, received a 14.5 percent
raise in his base salary to $630,000 but didn't receive a bonus. In 1999,
Smith's compensation package totaled $1.1 million.

HEADLINE: Top political aide discusses Bush's low-key style

BYLINE: By RON FOURNIER, AP White House Correspondent

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

??When 24 members of a Navy spy plane crew returned to the United States after
11-days in Chinese custody, President Bush was noticeably absent from their
homecoming ceremonies.

??He also kept a low profile as the Senate shrank his tax-cut plan by $400
billion, and had little to say about riots in Cincinnati this month.

??Such is the silent style of the new president, says Bush's top political
strategist, Karl Rove.

??""Every administration is marked in contrast to its predecessor. The previous
administration felt compelled to dominate the evening news every day and the
president said, 'I'm focused on getting the job done,""' Rove said Wednesday in
an Associated Press interview.

??Running a low-key presidency sets Bush apart from former President Clinton,
but the style has its critics.

??Some lawmakers, including members of his own party, said Bush could have
saved more of his $1.6 trillion tax-cut plan if he had personally lobbied more
lawmakers.

??Bush issued a statement expressing sympathy with police and protesters in
Cincinnati, but ran the risk of looking detached.

??And Rove acknowledged that there was some discussion in the White House 
about
Bush attending the U.S. crew's homecoming to reap the public relations reward
for freeing the crew.

??But the president vetoed the idea, according to Rove, who quoted Bush as
saying, ""I want it to be about them and I don't want to go through the
discombobulation that it would require of them and their families for me to 
show
up.""

??It is not hard to imagine Clinton commanding center stage during city riots,
a budget battle or an international crisis, but Rove said, ""We intended to 
have
a smaller profile than the previous administration.""

??Bush's ""attitude is that he's not going to be measured by whether or not he
gets on the evening news but on whether or not he gets progress,"" Rove said
during the 45-minute interview.

??He sat at a polished wood conference table in his West Wing office, his 
hands
folded over a memo he had discretely turned upside down. Newspapers and a
Starbucks coffee mug littered his desktop. Framed photos and artwork were
propped against a chair, still awaiting hanging on his 89th day in the White
House.

??A painting of a Texas landscape decorated one wall, allowing Bush's 
political
strategist of eight years to ""go on vacation whenever I'm on the phone.""

??Rove is on the telephone a lot these days crafting strategies to pass the
White House legislative agenda, maintain GOP control of Congress in 2002 and
position the president for a re-election bid in 2004.

??Bush narrowly won the White House without California's 54 electoral votes,
and Rove said the president could win re-election without the state ""but it's
always nicer to carry the Golden State.""

??He said the state's electricity shortage will not hurt Bush's chances in
2004, adding that the administration has done ""virtually everything"" Gov. Gray
Davis has requested.

??He suggested that the state caused its own problems by not building enough
power plants and failing to follow the lead of other states, such as Bush's
Texas, to establish sound energy policies before a crisis struck.

??""This has got a very human dimension to it,"" Rove said. ""It's one thing to
talk about power supplies. It's another thing when you talk about how it 
affects
their jobs, how it's affecting their livelihoods, how it's affecting the 
safety
of their communities and the health of their families. This is a tough issue 
and
it ought to be a wake up call for the entire country.""

??A White House task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney is working on
recommendations to address both short-term problems of soaring electricity and
natural gas prices and longer-term energy supply problems, focusing on 
producing
more domestic oil and gas and building more electric power plants.

??Rove said the administration will soon unveil new conservation measures 
aimed
at helping California ease its shortages.

??He said Bush and his political team are bringing House Republicans from
politically competitive states to the White House, where they discuss their
districts' needs and, often, gain local media attention.

??Bush also plans to attend fund-raisers for House and Senate campaign
committees, helping the party gear up for 2002 midterm elections in which
control of Congress is at stake.

??Rove also said:

??-Bush will not seek broad authority to negotiate trade treaties anytime 
soon,
allowing time to make the legislation more attractive to Democrats. ""You can
only put so much into that pipe, and we've stuffed it,"" he said of Bush's
crowded legislative agenda. The ""fast track"" authority is key to Bush's plans
for a free trade zone stretching from Canada to Chile. That proposal is the
focus of the three-day Summit of the Americas beginning Friday in Quebec City.

??-Americans will support Bush's environmental policies despite criticism of
his decision to overturn some initiatives of the final days of the Clinton
administration. Rove stopped short of accusing Clinton of setting Bush up for
political troubles. ""I'm not certain I see a conspiracy there. I do think it's
interesting"" that Clinton waited until the last moment to act.

??-Bush has not wavered since the campaign in his view that states should be
able to opt out of minimum wage increases passed by Congress. ""We are not all
one single labor market,"" Rove said.

HEADLINE: Utility commission staff says parent company profiting from energy
sales

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

BODY:

??IDACORP made $66 million in profits in the past year by buying electricity 
on
the spot market and reselling it for a higher price to its subsidiary, Idaho
Power Co., the staff for state utility regulators contends.

??The Idaho Public Utilities Commission staff said such profits should not 
come
at the expense of Idaho Power ratepayers facing staggering electrical bills.

??In a report to commissioners posted on the agency's Internet site Wednesday,
the staff recommended Idaho Power's proposed increases for residential and
commercial customers be cut by about half.

??Idaho Power seeks rate increases over the coming year totaling $227.4
million. The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. For
residential customers, a requested 34-percent hike would be reduced to 16
percent.

??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP 
and
Idaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff.""

??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions between
Idaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, the
staff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buy
electricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it.

??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP,
repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it to
Idaho Power for a profit.

??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could 
financially
cripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the open
market and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is 
increased.

??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beaman
said, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well.""

??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff - including Idaho Power employees
- a 15-percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company 
had
achieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before.

??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request.

??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of a
commission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesale
electricity to the Mid-Columbia Index. The index has been pegged at 
unrealistic
levels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates 
constantly.

??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter and
spirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman 
said.

??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a 
case
before them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho Supreme
Court.

??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended:

??- Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest,
until answers are available about the company's electricity deals.

??- Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when the
commissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5-percent interest. That part
of the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year - purchases
that the staff believes will be much more expensive next year.

??- Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it was
an error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned 
on
passing on to ratepayers.

??- Implementing a low-interest loan program to encourage energy conservation
by Idaho Power customers.

??- A two-year phase-in of any rate increase ultimately approved that is
substantially over 20 percent.

??- Changing residential rates to a three-tiered system to encourage savings.

??Homeowners would pay 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first 800 kwh 
used,
6.12 cents per kwh for use between 800 kwh and 2,000 kwh, and 7.48 cents per 
kwh
for use over 2,000 kwh. The current residential rate of 5.2 cents per kwh.

??The staff report also took Idaho Power to task, saying it was warned of the
possibility of spiraling prices and power shortages as far back as 1995.

??But the company contends it did not want to build generating plants during
the past decade because with electricity deregulation looming, nobody knew 
what
independent power facilities were being considered.

HEADLINE: Legislators probe possible power, natural gas collusion

BYLINE: By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

??Southern California Edison was charged about $750 million more this year for
natural gas because of unchecked free-market forces, an industry consultant
testified.

??Paul Carpenter told the Assembly Electricity Oversight Subcommittee on
Wednesday the price spikes came after the El Paso Natural Gas Co. contracted
first with Dynegy and later with its own marketing affiliate, El Paso Merchant
Energy, to control the pipeline capacity.

??Officials with El Paso and other natural gas suppliers are expected to
testify Thursday that they did not illegally manipulate the market.

??The California Public Utilities Commission estimated a year ago that
overcharges by the companies that control natural gas flow drove up prices by 
$
100 million a year to California gas and electricity customers.

??But PUC attorney Harvey Morris said that was before last summer's price
spikes, which he blamed on natural gas suppliers using a ""monopoly"" to ""game 
the
system.""

??""It's way worse than we could possibly have imagined,"" Morris said after
testifying before the subcommittee. ""It's obviously way higher than $100
million.""

??Natural gas rates at the California border generally tracked national prices
until November, when they spiked as high as 11 times higher than the price of
natural gas elsewhere in the nation, Carpenter said.

??""I have never seen gas prices like this anywhere in the world,"" said
Carpenter, who has been studying the energy market for 20 years for Cambridge,
Mass.-based consultant The Brattle Group. The Brattle Group was hired by 
Edison
to study the natural gas market.

??The committee is one of two legislative committees exploring whether illegal
market manipulation in the electricity and natural gas markets has driven up
California's energy costs.

??""This is a market that is plagued by the exercise of market power,"" Frank
Wolak, chairman of the California Independent System Operator's Market
Surveillance Committee, told the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price
Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market. The ISO runs the state's power
grid.

??However, ""there is no law against me saying, 'I'm not going to sell to 
you,""'
Wolak said. Market manipulation only becomes illegal when there is collusion,
Wolak said, and such evidence is hard to find.

??Electricity generators and natural gas suppliers say a severe supply and
demand imbalance - not market manipulation - has led to higher prices.

??""Everybody's busy doing investigations. They're not interested in solving 
the
problem,"" said Independent Energy Producers Executive Director Jan 
Smutny-Jones.

??Investigations ""are wasting everybody's time,"" Smutny-Jones said, adding 
that
previous probes and lawsuits have uncovered no wrongdoing. He said the state's
power problems came because state regulators denied utilities the chance to 
sign
long-term energy contracts when they had the chance.

??""People have been playing by the rules,"" Smutny-Jones said.

??But the Senate committee's first witnesses are ISO officials who authored
studies that claim the state paid more than $6 billion too much for power last
year.

??Committee chair Joseph Dunn, D-Garden Grove, also has slated state Auditor
Elaine Howell, who last month blamed buyers and sellers for skyrocketing
electricity costs. Dunn also has scheduled future testimony from state, 
federal,
academic and private investigators studying the power market.

??He invited five major generators to attend the committee's second hearing
next week. All five - Reliant, Dynegy, Williams Energy, Duke Energy and 
Mirant -
say they are eager to cooperate and clear their names, Dunn said.

??Dunn asked the five for a total of 86 specific documents. If the companies
feel they cannot provide documents because of legal or confidentiality 
concerns,
Dunn said he will subpoena them.

??Smutny-Jones said investigators appear to be growing desperate to blame the
state's natural gas and electricity price hikes on illegal market manipulation
instead of natural market forces.

??He cited Attorney General Bill Lockyer's announcement last week that any
informant who helped prove wrongdoing would be entitled to a percentage of the
state's recovery he estimated could range from $50 million to hundreds of
millions of dollars.

??""If the state's offering a $50 million reward, they haven't found anything,""
Smutny-Jones said. ""I don't think you're going to find the fact that anybody 
did
anything criminal here.""

??Assemblywoman Jenny Oropeza, D-Long Beach, said she believes otherwise after
Wednesday's testimony: ""I think it is very clear there was some price
manipulation going on.""

??But Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine, isn't sure there was anything
illegal.

??""There clearly are market forces at work, that's evident,"" Campbell said.
""Whether you make the jump to market manipulation ... I haven't seen 
conclusive
evidence that leads me to make that jump.""

From March 2000 to February 2001, natural gas prices have risen 489percent compared to a 266 percent increase in New Mexico and a 247 percent jumpin Chicago.??Steinberg asked Ralph Eads, the president of an El Paso Natural Gas Co.subsidiary, for an explanation.??""The 275 percent difference you say is attributable completely to constraintson the pipeline and demand?"" Steinberg asked.??""Yes,"" Eads replied. Eads said the state's energy crisis, which led powerplants to run harder and longer, dramatically increased demand for natural gasover the summer and a winter with temperatures about 15 percent cooler than theyear before exacerbated the problem.??In another twist to California's deregulation nightmare, El Paso officialssaid they gained greater control of the pipeline after the Pacific Gas &Electric Co. relinquished the capacity four years ago. At that time, PG&E'smovement of the gas and the prices it could charge were regulated by the PublicUtilities Commission.??In other developments at the Capitol on Thursday, lawmakers called on thefederal government to re regulate natural gas sales at the California borderand U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, DConn., said federal regulators should imposeprice caps on California's wholesale electricity market.??The Assembly held considerable debate on the resolution asking forreregulation, with Democrats accusing President George W. Bush of doing nothingto come to the aid of California and Republicans defending the administration.??""I'm learning an interesting lesson that all the problems of the worldstarted after Jan. 21 and the inauguration of the new president,"" saidAssemblyman Bill Leonard, RSan Bernardino.??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune??(c) 2001, Contra Costa Times (Walnut Creek, Calif.).??Visit the Contra Costa Times on the Web at http://www.cctimes.com/ JOURNALCODE: CCLOADDATE: April 20, 2001??????????????????????????????10 of 78 DOCUMENTS??????????????????????Copyright 2001 / Los Angeles Times??????????????????????????????Los Angeles Times?????????????????????April 20, 2001, Friday, Home EditionSECTION: Part A; Part 1; Page 3; Metro DeskLENGTH: 715 wordsHEADLINE: CALIFORNIA AND THE WEST;A UTURN ON CAR TAX REBATES;LEGISLATION: STARTING JULY 1, FEE REDUCTION WILL BE FIGURED DIRECTLY INTOVEHICLE REGISTRATION BILLS, NOT REFUNDED BY MAIL.BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERDATELINE: SACRAMENTOBODY:??Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature spun a Uturn Thursday and scrapped acostly program that requires motorists to first pay their car tax and then get arebate in the mail.??Starting July 1, the state Department of Motor Vehicles will send owners ofapproximately 26 million vehicles registration renewal bills already reduced bythe amount of the vehicle license fee rebates.??On a unanimous roll call, the Senate voted final approval and sent to Davisan ""urgency"" bill, SB 52, that repealed the rebate program, which the governorhad previously fought for and defended.??In addition to abolishing the rebates, the legislation reduces by 67.5% theamount motorists must pay for the upcoming year, the level that lawmakers andformer Gov. Pete Wilson envisioned in 1998 when they began cutting the fee. Ithad been about 2% of a vehicle's market value.??Davis immediately signed the repeal bill, saying only that the new law will""expedite relief to taxpayers and greatly reduce administrative costs.""??The governor's muted observation contrasted with his effusive support of therebates last year, when he said Californians ""don't appreciate the fact thatthey're getting a rebate unless they see it in their hands.""??At the time, Davis and the Legislature had the choice of simply cutting thecar tax, which voters might not notice, or sending checks in the mail, whichDavis felt would have a greater impact.??The rebates, which began Jan. 1, were scheduled to continue through 2002,when Davis intends to run for reelection. In 2003, the license fee was to havefallen permanently, with no more rebates.??""The whole rebate scheme was good only through the next gubernatorialelection cycle,"" said Sen. Tom McClintock (RThousand Oaks), who supportedreductions in the license fee but opposed the rebates.??Until July 1, the DMV will continue to bill motorists for the full amount oftheir license fee, which includes a 35% reduction from last year.??""Then we return to you an additional 32.5% rebate, making a total reductionof 67.5%,"" said DMV spokesman Bill Branch. Starting with license renewals onJuly 1, the DMV bills will include the full tax cut.??A Senate analysis of the repeal bill noted that the current ""awkward system .. . effectively requires taxpayers to overpay their vehicle license fee and thenawait a rebate check from the statea system that is, at best, difficult toexplain.""??But as the California economy tightened, the state's budget surplus shrankand taxpayers shelled out approximately $ 50 million a day to buy electricity, the costs of the rebate program threatened to become a political embarrassmentto Davis.??Projected administrative and postage costs of the rebate program alone wereestimated at $ 22 million this year and another $ 22 million or so next year.??Last year, state Sen. Joe Dunn (DSanta Ana) and McClintock sought toeliminate the rebates and give drivers their full tax cuts when they registertheir vehicles. Under pressure from Davis, the bill failed.??""It was killed behind the scenes at the insistence of the governor,""McClintock said Thursday. ""He didn't want it on his desk.""??This year, Dunn launched a similar bill, but his name was struck from it asthe lead author in the Assembly and the name of Sen. Wes Chesbro (DArcata) wassubstituted.??In a speech Thursday, Sen. Ross Johnson (RIrvine) suggested that Davis'performance on the issue in an ""earlier time and a more just society"" would haveresulted in his ""public flogging by representatives of taxpayers.""??The repeal bill was passed 78 to 0 by the Assembly on Monday, and sent toDavis by the Senate on a 340 vote Thursday.??If the rebates were to be abolished, the bill had to pass this week in orderto take effect July 1, said Branch, the DMV spokesman. This is because motoristsmust be advised 60 days in advance that their registration renewals are due.??""We have to reprogram all the computers. We have to print new bills and mailthem by May 1 for the July 1 expiration,"" he said.

Gray Davis, not only agreed about the severity of theproblem but also about the need for swift federal intervention.??""This meeting did not have the word 'Democrat' or 'Republican' used once,""Rep. Darrell E. Issa (RVista), said of the unusual spirit of cooperation at themeeting near Los Angeles International airport.??Members of both parties said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission mustslash wholesale electricity prices so California utilities can once again affordto buy power. Since January, the state government has been buying electricity ontheir behalf, as skyrocketing wholesale prices put Pacific Gas & Electric Co.and Southern California Edison billions of dollars into debt and many powersuppliers refused to sell to them; PG&E has since filed for Chapter 11bankruptcy protection.??Although the Bush administration has said repeatedly that it is stronglyopposed to price caps, and FERC has refused to grant them, CaliforniaRepublicans at the energy meeting said they are optimistic that theadministration will agree to some other form of price regulation. They brushedaside the notion that such regulations might conflict with their ideologicalbelief in a free market.??""This is not a freeenterprise situation,"" Rep. Duncan Hunter (RAlpine) saidafter the meeting. ""In fact, it's just the opposite.""??Specifically citing the huge disparity between natural gas prices charged toCalifornia and those charged in other Western states, he said California clearlyhas been the victim of unreasonably high energy costs. Under federal law, theFERC must regulate the prices of companies if it finds they are exerting ""marketpower"" to drive prices to unreasonable levels.??Executives from two Texas energy companies, meeting with legislators inSacramento, denied Thursday that they had caused natural gas prices inCalifornia to artificially skyrocket by hoarding access to a critical pipelineinto the state.??After the extraordinary meeting in Los Los Angeles, Rep. Brad Sherman(DSherman Oaks) said the biggest disagreement between California Democrats andRepublicans appeared to be their relative faithor lack thereofin the abilityof President Bush and his administration to help California. There has been muchspeculation that Bush, who lost California in November, has no political motiveto help the state.??""We Democrats,"" said Sherman, ""hope very much that our skepticism is provenwrong.""??Daviswho sat flanked by Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and thegovernor's newly appointed chief energy advisor, S. David Freemansaid he usedthe meeting mainly to discuss the importance of conservation by Californiansthis summer and to ask the congressional delegation to pitch in. FiveRepublicans and more than a dozen Democrats attended the gathering.??Feinstein said Thursday that she has asked for a third time to meet with Bushto discuss the energy situation. Meeting with Times reporters and editorsWednesday, she described a recent meeting with Vice President Dick Cheney inwhich, she said, he ""ignored"" her appeal for federal assistance.??Feinstein has been among those critical of natural gas companies, saying theyappear to have constricted access to a Californiabound pipeline to run upprices.??The Brattle Group, a respected consulting firm, alleged Wednesday before anAssembly committee that Dynegy Inc. and El Paso Natural Gas Co. had manipulatedthe market by charging so much for the rights to their pipeline capacity thatthey had, in effect, withheld access to it.??That action, the experts said, directly forced companies trying to delivergas to California to look for alternatives, clogging other pipelines and causinga surge in prices.??The explanation, El Paso executives said, was simple: Demand for gas soaredin California because generators that use gas to make electricity increasedproduction last year in response to the energy crisis.??""We're not withholding capacityno one is,"" said El Paso Merchant EnergyPresident Ralph Eads. ""With these prices, you want to sell every molecule.""??In other developments Thursday:??* The agreement between Davis and Edison International to return its ailingutility arm to financial health is in ""deep trouble and could be rejected bylegislators,"" the Standard & Poor's credit rating agency said in a note toclients, citing legislative and other sources. A rejection of the deal ""would bea humiliating setback for the governor,"" S&P said.??The agreement calls for, among other things, the sale of Edison'stransmission grid to the state for $ 2.76 billion and the sale of $ 2 billion inbondsboth designed to pay off the utility's huge electricity debt. Edisonagreed to several constraints, including the sale of electricity to the state atprices tied to the cost of producing power.??Since they returned Monday from a twoweek recess, state legislators havebeen sharply critical of the Edison agreement and have indicated a desire totinker with aspects of the deal. Some lawmakers have said publicly that abankruptcy protection filing by Edison, like that of PG&E, might not be such adire outcome.??But a senior Edison executive said it is ""way too early"" to give up onpassage of the proposal, which legislators have not yet seen in official form.??""There is an education process to do here,"" the executive said of the highlydetailed 38page document. ""The legislators should be asking questions. That isappropriate.""??* The Public Utilities Commission voted to investigate whether alternativeenergy providers violated contractual agreements by withholding supplies fromPG&E and Edison, which owe them hundreds of millions of dollars.??The action, Commissioner Carl W. Wood said, was prompted in part by lawsuitssome providers have filed seeking release from their contracts with thecashstarved utilities. The producers of solar, wind and geothermal energyaccount for more than 25% of California's electricity supply.??""The question is whether we will be able to rely on them in the long, hotdays of summer,"" Wood said.??Jack Raudy of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee said the PUC needs toaddress the $ 700 million the producers are owed. ""All we have gotten isrhetoric from the governor, the PUC and the utilities,"" he said.??* An $ 850million plan to entice Californians to conserve precious megawattsappears to be running into roadblocks, compounding predictions by stateofficials of tighter than expected energy supplies in May and June.??Davis signed the conservation spending package last week, earmarking $ 242million of the new funds for the Public Utilities Commission to distribute tothe state's investorowned utilities to support existing conservation programs.??But Barbara Hale, director of the PUC's Division of Strategic Planning, saidThursday that since Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed for bankruptcy protectionApril 6, the utility has stopped releasing conservation funds.??Hale, testifying before a state Senate committee, said PG&E'sdecisioncoupled with the threat that Southern California Edison could follow asimilar route to U.S. Bankruptcy Courthas complicated her agency's efforts.??PG&E spokeswoman Staci Homrig said her company plans to petition theBankruptcy Court to have the conservation funds designated as a trust andseparated from assets tied up in the bankruptcy proceedings. She said if thecourt denies the request, PG&E would ask to be permitted to pay the expensesanyway. The process, she added, could take about a monthtoo long in the viewof some legislators, given increasingly gloomy energy forecasts for late springand early summer.??Deputy Director Bob Therkelsen of the California Energy Commission said hisagency had been counting on a number of small power producers to bolster theiroutput during that period. But he said some producers did not purchase thenecessary equipment because PG&E and Edison have failed to pay them in full forearlier electricity deliveries.??""It's not a huge amount,"" he said of the anticipated production shortfall,""but every little bit helps.""??*??Landsberg reported from Los Angeles, Bustillo from Sacramento.

There issome willingness, they say, to consider some price controls, even though theBush administration is adamantly opposed to such measures.??Many are looking to see if President Bush's choices for the two vacancies onFERC will provide a margin for change.??But the commission's basic philosophy that open, unregulated markets are bestis not likely to change soon, members say.??""I've been championing a revamping of FERC's antiquated standards fordetermining marketbased rates,"" Commissioner Richard Massey said Thursday. Butwith no success. "" My agency is not on the verge of turning on a dime on thismarketbased pricing.""??The standards are a joke, Massey added, because the commission never turnsdown requests for such pricing authority. More than 600 power sellers have beengiven that authority, he said.??For a power company to be allowed to charge whatever the market will bear, itmust show FERC, for example, that it doesn't have the power to manipulate themarket and drive prices up.??""Any seller that can't pass our screen needs to fire their consultants andlawyers,"" Massey said.??While the overall philosophy remains consistent, FERC staff has proposed tothe commission that a Stage 3 electricity emergency in California should triggercostbased rates, a form of price controls. Such triggers would be in place forone year, under the staff proposal.??The commission may decide Wednesday whether to accept that proposal. It hasto make some decision by May 1 on how the market will be monitored from now on.??The theory behind controlling prices in Stage 3, says a FERC staff report, isthat during such an emergency generators have the greatest opportunity tomanipulate the market and drive prices up.??But generators have that power during Stage 2 and Stage 1 emergencies, saysLes Starck, Southern California Edison Co.'s manager of federal regulatoryaffairs. Price caps during Stage 3 might avert the rolling blackouts associatedwith that level of crisis, but they wouldn't do anything to stop generators fromjacking up prices the rest of the time, he said.??It is not clear how long it would take for such price controls to takeeffect, should the commission go along with the staff recommendation.??""We're close because summer is approaching,"" Commissioner Linda Breathittsaid Thursday. Breathitt, who had firmly opposed any form of price controls,said in an interview last month that given the worsening crisis in Californiashe was open to considering some shortterm measures.??""It's important to me that we address the summer,"" Breathitt said, but saidshe wasn't able to predict what the commission would do Wednesday.??Even if an order is approved, Massey said, there could be delays while thepower sellers file their costs with regulators and disputes over those filingsare handled.??Sen. Dianne Feinstein said Thursday such a move by the commission would be""better than having no controls at all. There's no question that we're going tobe in a Stage 3 emergency.""??Feinstein, DCalif., and other Western lawmakers have been urging FERC tostep in sooner and with price controls that extend beyond just the emergencyperiod.??Waiting for Stage 3 to intervene ""is putting the whole grid at risk,"" saidRoger Hamilton, a member of Oregon's Public Utility Commission. ""We have a realstability problem when you cut it that close.""??Feinstein says the future could well rest with the new commissioners,particularly Patrick Wood, the head of the Texas PUC who many believe willreplace Curt Heber as FERC chairman if he is confirmed by the Senate.??Even if Massey and Breathitt agree on broader price controls, as chairman,Heber could block consideration of such a move. It's unclear what stance Woodwould take as chairman.??""The thing that deeply concerns me about Pat Wood is that he's from Texas,""Feinstein said. ""What's reassuring is that it appears from my personaldiscussion with him is that he appears to be pragmatic.""??But once again, timing could be a problem.??Bush has said he intends to nominate Wood and Nora Brownell, a member of thePennsylvania PUC, but has not formally sent their nominations to the Senate.??""The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is of vital importance right now,and to let the time go on without filling the spots makes no sense,"" Feinsteinsaid.

Earlier this week, Gov. Gray Davis announced that theaverage daily bill for electricity purchases has risen from $45.8 million a dayin the last week of March, to $73 million a day.??Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's have already issued their owncredit warnings, although none of the three agencies has actually downgraded thestate's very good doubleA credit rating.??Bond ratings are important yardsticks that bankers and investors use to pricemunicipal and corporate bonds. A downgrade would force California to offerbondbuyers higher interest rates going forward, costing taxpayers.??The state was last at a lower A rating back in 1994.??Moody's changed California's Aa2 general obligation bond rating outlook fromstable to negative on April 6, the day Pacific Gas & Electric Co. filed forbankruptcy. Standard & Poor's has had the state's AA rating outlook at negativesince January, when the state began buying electricity for the utilities.??The deciding factor for Fitch, said Fitch vice chairman Claire Cohen, was thedisagreement over how the money from the new electricity rate hike will bespent.??The California Public Utilities Commission ruled in late March that moneygenerated by higher electricity bills should go first to pay the stateDepartment of Water Resources, which has been buying electricity for theutilities. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. has argued that if the state is paidfirst, there won't be any money left for it.??The utility is formally challenging the PUC decision, and the move threatensto hold up the estimated $12 billion to $14 billion of bonds the Department ofWater Resources plans to issue to buy more electricity.??""With that being appealed you don't have a clean authorization,"" Cohen said.""It signals to me that it could delay the financing process.""??A second concern is that the state isn't collecting as much in taxes asexpected, Cohen said. Tax collections for both February and March were belowforecast. The amount of personal income tax the state collected in those monthsfell short by $455 million, or 14% less than expected.??Cohen said she made her decision before hearing that the state's power costsnow exceed $70 million a day. Cohen and David Hitchcock, the California analystfor Standard & Poors, agreed those rising costs are a definite concern.??""It doesn't take much of a change in economic growth to make some of theseprojected fund balances disappear and so we're very worried about what thecurrent economic activity is, particularly in Northern California with some ofthe problems with the high tech area,"" Hitchcock told analysts and investorslast week in a conference call.??State treasurer Phillip Angelides was traveling Thursday and couldn't bereached for comment. Other economywatchers expressed concern.??Sandy Harrison, assistant director of the state Dept. of Finance, said themove reinforced the importance of solving the current power problems soon.??""It's important to note that the rating hasn't been lowered yet and doesremain very strong,"" he said.??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, athttp://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNALCODE: SJLOADDATE: April 20, 2001??????????????????????????????18 of 78 DOCUMENTS??????????????Copyright 2001 Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service???????????????????????Knight Ridder/Tribune News Service????????????????????????????San Jose Mercury News????????????????????????????April 20, 2001, FridaySECTION: STATE AND REGIONAL NEWSKRACCNO: ?K520LENGTH: 1069 wordsHEADLINE: Issues still remain on what power consumers will eventually payBYLINE: By John Woolfolk and Michael BazeleyBODY:??SAN JOSE, Calif. _ State regulators last month announced an electric rateincrease that would average a whopping three cents per kilowatt hour, hit billsbeginning in May and punish power pigs while sparing energy misers.??Now, much of that is up in the air.??Higher rates are surely coming _ but not before June.

But key details yet to be decided mean consumerscould see their average rates go up anywhere from 7 percent to 30 percent ormore.??Among them:??_How much of an overall increase?

Gray Davis' hike _ left vague in Davis' April 5 televisionaddress _ averages 2.8 cents for PG&E customers but only 2.3 cents for customersof Southern California Edison.??_What regions of the state will pay? The commission agreed to raise ratesonly for Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison, but Davis wouldinclude the additional 1.2 million San Diego Gas & Electric customers.??_Should heavier users of electricity subsidize those who are exempt from thenew rate increase? If so, those users will find themselves paying much more thanany of the average increase figures being tossed about.??_How will utilities bill customers retroactively for the increase?

Public hearings would follow May 711, and the commissionwould vote on a plan May 14, condensing to a few weeks a process that normallylasts nearly a year.??Each of the major proposals before the commission assumes that residentialcustomers using less than 130 percent of their baseline would be exempt fromhigher rates. That's mandated under a new law that allows the state to buypower. Customers already pay higher rates for exceeding their baseline, which isthe average basic level of use for each region of the state.??Each major proposal also sets new ""tiers"" with progressively higher rates for""medium"" use at 130 to 200 percent of baseline and ""heavy"" use over 200 percentof that level.??But that's where the similarities end.??The first distinction among the leading plans comes in the form of anassumption: How many residential customers will avoid any increase because theydon't exceed 130 percent of their baseline? Davis says more than half,commissioners say a little under half and PG&E says less than a third.??The second difference among the plans is a real difference: What happens toeveryone else???Under the plan by utilities commission President Loretta Lynch, medium PG&Eusers would see average bills rise 9 percent and heavy users would see billsincrease 36 percent.??Davis' plan says medium PG&E users would see average bills rise 11 percentwhile heavy users would pay 37 percent more. But the average total bill increasefor PG&E residential customers, including those who are exempt, would be 20percent under his plan and 24 percent under Lynch's, according to a statement onthe governor's web site.??Business customers would see proportionately greater increases, averaging 30percent under Lynch's proposal and 26 percent under Davis'.??The most consumerfriendly of the various proposals comes fromconsumerrights group TURN. They suggest an overall average residential increaseof just 7.5 percent.??TURN's plan assumes utilities cannot charge other customers more to make upfor the energy misers shielded from rate increases under state law.??PG&E disagrees with that interpretation. The utility wants other residentialusers to make up for any lost revenue from exempted customers through higherrates. Under the utility's plan, residential customers would see an average ratehike of nearly 30 percent.??""The proposal these folks are pushing rips the heart out of that law,"" saidMatthew Freedman, staff attorney for TURN.??Another issue affecting consumers is how the utilities can bill forelectricity used in April and May, before the final plan is approved.??Utility officials have objected to making the rate structure retroactive.Instead, to recoup the revenue, they are proposing a flat surcharge thateveryone would pay, regardless of how much they use.??Edison proposes a higher surcharge added to bills for a shorter period oftime _ in this case, June through August. PG&E officials are suggesting asmaller surcharge that would be spread out over 12 months.??""It'll probably be something closer to the PG&E proposal,"" Paul Clanon, thecommission's director of energy issues.??All the rate increase proposals stem from a commonly understood problem:California's current, frozen rates don't generate enough money to cover thewholesale price of power. The PUC raised rates 10 percent _ or 1 cent perkilowatt hour _ in January in an attempt to help, but that turned out to be farfrom enough.??In March, the Commission approved an additional 3cent increase. But Davisfollowed quickly with an alternative proposal. The next day, PG&E filed forbankruptcy, raising the specter that a federal judge could order even higherrates.??Although the PUC has sole authority to raise rates under state law, Davis'proposal has complicated an already complex process. The governor appointedthree of the five members of the commission, and his appointees seem inclined toshow him deference. But Davis has been slow in filing the details of his plan,which has made it hard for the PUC to proceed.??KRT CALIFORNIA is a premium service of Knight Ridder/Tribune??(c) 2001, San Jose Mercury News (San Jose, Calif.).??Visit Mercury Center, the World Wide Web site of the Mercury News, athttp://www.sjmercury.com/ JOURNALCODE: SJLOADDATE: April 20, 2001??????????????????????????????19 of 78 DOCUMENTS?????????????????Copyright 2001 The Chronicle Publishing Co.?????????????????????????The San Francisco Chronicle????????????????????APRIL 20, 2001, FRIDAY, FINAL EDITIONSECTION: NEWS; Pg.

The regulatory staff recommends a $108.7 million increase. Forresidential customers, a requested 34percent hike would be reduced to 16percent.??""This is not a final decision,"" said Jeff Beaman, a spokesman for IDACORP andIdaho Power. ""In many cases, the commissioners disagree with the staff.""??The report noted there was nothing illegal about the transactions betweenIdaho Power and its sister company, Idaho Energy Systems. To change that, thestaff urged commissioners to create a mechanism that forces Idaho Power to buyelectricity at the same price Idaho Energy Systems pays for it.??The report said Idaho Energy Systems, an unregulated subsidiary of IDACORP,repeatedly purchased electricity on the wholesale market and then sold it toIdaho Power for a profit.??Idaho Power officials contend the recommended policy change could financiallycripple the company. It already spent $161 million buying power on the openmarket and cannot recover the money unless the coming year's rate is increased.??""The failure to recoup these funds could lead to liquidity problems,"" Beamansaid, ""and that will hurt not only the company but our customers as well.""??But IDACORP paid all of its salaried staff  including Idaho Power employees a 15percent bonus at the end of the last fiscal year because the company hadachieved record profits of $139.9 million, 53 percent over the year before.??Beaman said incentive payments have no impact on the rate request.??Charging the higher rate between the two subsidiaries was the result of acommission order tying the price that Idaho Energy charges for wholesaleelectricity to the MidColumbia Index. The index has been pegged at unrealisticlevels since the energy crisis erupted in California, and fluctuates constantly.??""We are confident that the transactions were performed within the letter andspirit of the law, and have not been at the expense of ratepayers,"" Beaman said.??Commission spokesman Gene Fadness said commissioners cannot comment on a casebefore them, but their ultimate decision can be appealed to the Idaho SupremeCourt.??The Public Utilities Commission staff also recommended:?? Deferring $66.1 million of Idaho Power's rate request, without interest,until answers are available about the company's electricity deals.?? Deferring another $45.8 million of the request until next year, when thecommissioners would allow Idaho Power to collect 5percent interest. That partof the hike was earmarked for wholesale power purchases this year  purchasesthat the staff believes will be much more expensive next year.?? Cutting another $10.3 million from the increase request, contending it wasan error by Idaho Power's Risk Management Committee that the company planned onpassing on to ratepayers.??

Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:

The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois.

I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting

Steve,

Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal
rules going forward.

My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions
to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full 
picture.
Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no
control long-term.

I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules
for the Research sign-off.

Vince

Subject: Research sign off

Hi Sharad

I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to 
sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to 
do from time to time.

I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what 
it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and 
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot 
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I 
feel falls firmly within RAC territory.

This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other 
groups after all?  To ""sign off"" means to accept something, which our opinion 
in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical 
note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving 
the formal ""sign off"" to those best placed to assess these risks for our 
company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view

The company for which the account needs to be set up is:

ECT Europe Finance Inc. (company 030S).

I believe that this company's constitutional docs are held in Houston - and my guess is that the authorized officers are also in Houston.  I suggest that you liaise with the company secretarial department in Houston (Kate Cole) to resolve this.

Let me know if I can be of further help.

Edmund

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a ""fair value"" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund","['Message-ID: <1115517.1075854930333.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Tue, 9 Oct 2001 07:50:07 -0700 (PDT)', 'From: edmund.cooper@enron.com', 'To: tom.doukas@enron.com', 'Subject: RE: Prime Account Needed', 'Cc: david.wall@enron.com, jeff.kinneman@enron.com, paul.pizzolato@enron.com, sara.shackleton@enron.com, marie.heard@enron.com', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit', 'Bcc: david.wall@enron.com, jeff.kinneman@enron.com, paul.pizzolato@enron.com, sara.shackleton@enron.com, marie.heard@enron.com', 'X-From: Cooper, Edmund </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=EU/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=ECOOPER>', 'X-To: Doukas, Tom </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=TDOUKAS>', 'X-cc: Wall, David </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=EU/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=DWALL5>, Kinneman, Jeff </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=JKINNEM>, Pizzolato, Paul </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=PPIZZOL>, Shackleton, Sara </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=SSHACKL>, Heard, Marie </O=ENRON/OU=NA/CN=RECIPIENTS/CN=MHEARD>', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\MHEARD (Non-Privileged)\\Heard, Marie\\Brokerage Agreements', 'X-Origin: Heard-M', 'X-FileName: MHEARD (Non-Privileged).pst', '', 'The company for which the account needs to be set up is:', '', 'ECT Europe Finance Inc.

To:	All Enron Employees United States Group@ENRON
Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.

Please take time between now and year's end to check the Vacation hours 
balance you have in the SAP system.   If there is a discrepancy, please ask 
HR to correct, and keep me advised should you need time sheet copies.

Carolyn usually has to approve reports at year end (or Jan-2001) for Vacation

Kay,

I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.

FYI.  Calger is in active talks with Freeman and DWR lawyers about the offer 
letter we submitted on Tuesday.  Freeman's very anxious to do a deal for 200 
MWs from the West Desk and then start talking about a deal for power from 
Parquet's Pastoria plant.  Credit is of course the issue and Calger's told 
them that unless the credit issue is bulletproof it's not going to work.  See 
Chris' comments below.  It looks like progress is being made, but the details 
will make it or break it.  Any thoughts?  Might make sense to discuss on the 
call.  Please forward along to others.  Thanks.

		 Subject: CDWR Credit Proposal

CDWR is proposing to all potential suppliers the following security package 
for new PPA's:

1) Irrevocable PUC Order / Agreement that ""locks in the revenue stream"" for 
CDWR to cover the PPA costs.

2) PPA covenant that the power supplier has payment priority over any debt, 
including the contemplated debt issue
  - the concept is that the supply is the operating cost and any debt would 
be subordinate

3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more 
favorable terms or priority to ayone, no L/C, etc.


Subject to definitive language, CDWR is trying to get people to buy into this 
general plan.  What do people think?  Please try to shoot holes in this.  
Please forward to the appropriate legal, regulatory and credit folks to air 
this out.

Thanks,

Chris

Susan,

Can you let me know if we have a recent Assignment Agreement for the above 
referenced Counterparty?  We are recieving Confirmations with the 'Electric 
Utilities' crossed out of their name.   Leaving the name as PPL Corporation.  
These are EOL deals, therefore we cannot change this to match them unless we 
have done some Assignment Agreement that we haven't seen.  Let me know if you 
know anything.

Thanks,
Joe

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you
made from selling Enron stock before the company
declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee
Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's
employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide
relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't
afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made
millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers
and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of
Enron's employees were financially devastated when the
company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans
were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit
during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result,
there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay
their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is
bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million
worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the
company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this
money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those
Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Steven Bollock","['Message-ID: <26905442.1075860824700.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Wed, 30 Jan 2002 09:48:05 -0800 (PST)', 'From: rembrandt@siskiyou.net', 'To: klay@enron.com', 'Subject: Demand Ken Lay Donate Proceeds from Enron Stock Sales', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit', 'X-From: ""rembrandt@siskiyou.net"" <rembrandt@siskiyou.net>@ENRON', 'X-To: klay@enron.com', 'X-cc: ', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\Kenneth_Lay_Mar2002\\Lay, Kenneth\\Deleted Items', 'X-Origin: Lay-K', 'X-FileName: klay (Non-Privileged).pst', '', 'Steven Bollock', '1002 McCloud Ave.', 'Mt.

Please donate thismoney to the funds set up to help repair the lives of thoseAmericans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.Sincerely,Steven Bollock",['klay@enron.com'],1

Nick,

Thanks for your message. My family is in Houston for the Christmas holidays
and  this means I am not coming any time soon to Stanford.
I shall probably visit the campus for the Parents Weekend. Let's
plan to meet for dinner then.

I am very glad that you have recruited the 2nd PhD student for the research  
project.
We are discussing internally what would be the best topic(s) for the project
and we should be ready to talk to you in the nearest future about it.
It makes a lot of sense for you to visit Enron to finalize the selection
of the research topics.

We shall be glad to take both Eric and Giuseppe as summer interns.
Everybody  was immensely impressed with Giuseppe and we shall 
welcome him with open arms.

I shall get in touch with you in the beginning of January to finalize the 
arrangements for your trip and our meeting at Stanford.

Vince

Hello Vince and Stinson,

First of all,

BEST WISHES FOR HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!

If you are in the Stanford area during the holidays, let's get together
some time to have dinner.

I have formally established the project - thanks again for funding
it - and I have also recruited the second PhD student. His name is
Eric Cope, and he is a top-notch student, very mature, and entrepreneurial!

We have started working on some interesting problems in this area. I would
hope that Eric could spend the coming summer at Enron to get immersed into
the ""problem/opportunity generation environment."" That really helps the 
student
to develop a realistic vision about their research.

Perhaps, our whole team could visit Enron again some time in the next quarter,
say in March or so, to discuss the research issues we are pursuing. And of 
course
you could visit us before that too.


With my WARMEST WISHES,

Nick

Joe,

As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business 
plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to 
facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.  When you get a chance to 
examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your 
views and your view of the best way forward.  We have everyone thinking about 
it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.

It will help with Morten Erik as well.

Thanks,
Mike","['Message-ID: <5664866.1075843958649.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Thu, 3 May 2001 06:03:00 -0700 (PDT)', 'From: mike.mcconnell@enron.com', 'To: joseph.hirl@enron.com', 'Subject: ', 'Cc: jeffrey.shankman@enron.com', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit', 'Bcc: jeffrey.shankman@enron.com', 'X-From: Mike McConnell', 'X-To: Joseph P Hirl', 'X-cc: Jeffrey A Shankman', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\Mark_McConnell_June2001\\Notes Folders\\Sent', 'X-Origin: MCCONNELL-M', 'X-FileName: mmcconn.nsf', '', 'Joe,', '', 'As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business ', 'plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to ', 'facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.

I talked  with Jamie  Rosenfeld,  the   CERA  SVP     and he  said Dan Yergin 
is 
very much interested in this  type of   advocacy  and  right now is highly 
sought out by TV  and   print media  on these  same   issues which are of 
concern  to Enron -- on  supply  security,  managing  price volatility  and 
supply  turmoil, avoiding regulatory  backlash,  and promoting just  letting 
the  market  work .  Beyond   Dan  taking   media  referrals  and  an Op  Ed 
--  they suggested   several more  ideas.  

1.  November  1-2  is  CERA's Houston Conference Roundtable.  The  day 
before  the Conference Enron  could host  a special  session,  a top 100  
Leadership Circle, or  a special dinner  and   dinnner /speaker  to which key 
media  would  be  invited.  Enron  could  invite  special  attendees  like  
PUC, NARUC  ,  Congressional  types  and other Opiniion Leaders  to attend.  
We  would   get the  shadow  benefit  of   1500-2000  attendees  and media  
in town  for the  Roundtable  the next  day.  

2.
In concert with the  recent  release  of   the   CERA  Electric Power  Trends 
publication,  CERA  would quickly  prepare  a  similar  short  version of  a 
Natural  Gas Trends publication (much is on the shelf   already)  and  
Enron   could  purchase  bulk   copies of  each .  We  could  use a  custom  
cover letter  from  Ken and/or Jeff   as the opportunity  to  inform    PUC  
chairs, key  Members  of  Congress,  the  two  Presidential  campaigns' 
leadership  and other Opinion leaders about  issues of importance  to Enron  
and its   businesses  -- this merges nicely  with
the  pro  energy  choice, pro markets, pro deregulation  messages contained 
in the  text and  graphics of  Cera's  Trends  publications.

3.
Enron  could   sponsor     a  10 minute  and  or even  a 30- 40 minute   
Energy  Security  themed  multi media  presentation  full of  intellectual 
content  addressing the  key  electricity  and gas  reliability  and pro 
market forces  messages  Enron is  espousing .We would   advise  target 
audiences in  a  letter  as to how to access  the show on the Cera  media  
center  on their  web site  and  Cera  could  do this in concert with   
EBS.   Or  it   could  be  an add- on  to  the  Trends  publication/ letter  
send  out.  In any case  the multi media message  gets the  advantage of  
exposure  to  the 10 000  eyeballs  the  CERA  site   already offers. 

4.   In Feb  CERA  has  its  Houston Executive  Conference.  If  we have  a  
rough  winter  that  could  be  great timing
for  Enron  to  use this  as a Problem Solving and Policy Setting Forum  for 
a  high level   'how  to'  Workshop --and/or   invite  in  some  natural  gas 
and electricity  end  users  and/or  gas distributor speakers  from  the   
buy side that  ""did it  right""  and  can  talk  about   how they  hedged  or  
set  up their  portfolios    to make it  successfully through a  tough  
winter market.  Security  analyst speakers talking  about   doing it the  
right  way  would also be  useful.

My   thought  is  that   Item   2.    sending  the  Trends  publications   
coupled with   brief  multi media  messaging
(from  Item 3) might  give us the bigger   impact  faster and more  
targeted   than  the others.  

 Do any of  these  appeal   to  you  ?

Hey,

Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need 
to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in 
town this week.

The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
holidays like I'd hoped.

I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.

John:

I spoke with Tim yesterday evening regarding your feedback to the 
compensation proposal I sent last week. Before our conversation this morning 
I wanted to give you a chance to review some of thoughts I have which might 
help keep our discussion more focused. 

First, I think we've both been at Enron about the same amount of time and 
probably share similar experiences about contracts and compensation at Enron. 
In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information 
by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, 
compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies. Just as we all 
have to create our own path at Enron we generally must do our own research 
and draw our own conclusions about compensation within and outside Enron. In 
several cases we have lost people we are trying to contract as a result of 
the contracting process! In my opionion, this is mostly because of the lack 
of communication of any ""overall compensation plan"" which drives people to 
the market to make an evaluation which they otherwise may not be inclined to 
do if information were available. Among the many ENA managers I have worked 
with none has ever explained any such ""plan"". Tim has indicated that there is 
some sort of overall compensation structure plan that you and Dave Delainey 
are trying to adhere to. I would appreciate some discussion about this as it 
may relieve some of the concerns we all end up having about signing a 
contract without being 100% satisfied with the minimum amounts in the 
contract (primarily because we've experienced the verbal commitment which is 
forgotten or lost in the latest management shuffle). 

Second, Tim indicated some concern about locking in certain minimum overall 
compensation levels and that ""if a person were to have a bad year there may 
be no room for bonus"". I think this is a real concern particularly when we 
consider a new trader from outside the company. In my case, while I currently 
don't have a specific book that gets marked each day, I think there is a 
clear record over the past seven years of significant value to ENA's west 
power business. This value comes in several forms: value above the 
offer/below the bid, market information driving both short and long-term 
value into our books, developing new markets and products for ENA, extending 
my market knowledge and deal structuring capabilities on a continuous basis 
each day to other origination/strucuturing/mid-market/real time groups, 
building a no-risk/high value Services business, and providing leadership to 
employees about their role at Enron or Enron's role in the market. All of 
these efforts are focused on adding mark-to-market value to ENA in more ways 
than any single, specific book can measure. I am certain that I will continue 
to add value in these ways and have little concern about this ""bad year"" 
scenario.

Finally, I am trying to make sense of the proposed compensation that Tim has 
relayed to me. If I understand it correctly my cash compensation pay would 
change from $206k ($130 base /$56 COLA /$50 retention) over the past three 
years as a Director to a base pay of $170k as a Vice President with higher 
expections and increasing responsibilities. The equity plan that is currently 
available to Vice Presidents and above would be locked in at values of 
$175/$125. This one is a little hard for me to evaluate as it is new in its 
current form (I have been a participant in prior years of similar equity 
plans which have ranged in initial from $10k-$50k as a Director). Bonus would 
be determined annually, I assume under similar process as past years. The 
trouble I am having is evaluating a significant decrease in cash compensation 
after being promoted and locking in a known (versus unknown) value in an 
equity plan for which I presumably am already a participant in and for which 
there is little other plan information available to evaluate.  I would 
appreciate your thoughts on this in relation to any overall compensation 
""plan"".

I'll look forward to our discussion.

In general, my experience is that there has never been any open information by management about any overall compensation structures, equity plans, compatability between ENA groups or other Enron companies.

		 Subject: BuySideDirect - Outstanding Issues

My understanding is that the following issues are outstanding with regard to 
the Buy Side Direct agreements:

Buy Side Direct Agreement:

Notice - Sara is developing proposed guidelines for notification (how + who 
should receive).

Indemnity (#6) - Jason and Sara will discuss.  

I would encourage you to discuss these issues without me unless you prefer 
that I participate.   

Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement:

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Mike Minnich noted that WPG had agreed to our other comments.  Have we 
received a revised WPG agreement with these changes ?

As noted below, I have asked Sheila to provide information required for the 
BSD and WPG agreements.  

Please let me know if there are other issues which I should be involved in 
discussing.  

Thanks.

Subject: BuySideDirect Agreement

It appears that we are close to resolving outstanding legal issues regarding 
the agreement to allow online bond trading through Buy Side Direct.   Sheila, 
is your group the appropriate area to complete the Subscriber Application and 
Attachment 2 documents provided below ?  

We will also execute an agreement with Buy Side Direct's clearing firm 
(Weiss, Peck & Greer) which will direct them to clear our trades through the 
prime broker we designate.    Sheila, I will leave you a paper copy of the 
preliminary version of this agreement.  Is your group the appropriate area to 
complete the information this agreement requires on pages 7 and 8 - 
essentially, tax ID # and account # ?

Eric / Tom, please handle any communication required with our prime broker 
required before we initiate trading on Buy Side Direct.

Sara / Jason, please let me know if I am overlooking any other information 
that we will require from Sheila's group related to Buy Side Direct.  

(Approval from our Credit group is expected this week.)

Thanks.

I made the two remaining changes:

1. added limits on clearly erroneous policy time limits.  We will promptly
notify other side and will make a decision within 4 hours of the issue being
raised or by 6PM whichever is sooner.
2. deleted first sentence from 5.4

I am still trying to get further resolution from WPG with regard to your
insert #6.

Please call with any questions.

Subject: Enron-BuySideDirect Agreement


I apologize for the delay.  I made the changes as discussed except:

1.  I did not put a limit on the Clearly erroneous policy--not because I
didn't agree, but because I did not see an obvious answer in the Nasdaq
agreement.  I will look at it more tomorrow, but I wanted to get this to you
rather than delay further.
2.  Striking first sentence in 5.4--I have not heard back from our lawyers.
Hopefully tomorrow.

Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
have.

I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.

If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.

Regards,

Mike

Steve,

SDG&E came out with the attached RFP for fixed price power.  They are 
requesting proposals for several standard blocks through 12/03.  Responses 
are due August 30.  ENA/EPMI will be prepared to respond, if appropriate.  In 
the meantime, we continue to price the full requirements residential 
structure and await any news from the governor's office/legislature.  I can 
be reached at 503-464-3735.

Regards,

Chris

call me.  I haven't gotten anyone yet that speaks my language yet.  Then the

There is 4 proposed decisions that came out today. The CPUC is set to vote =
on=20
them tomorrow.  Here is a quick overview:

1) Two decisions address how much money is collected for going forward=20
electric energy costs and how much of that is paid to CDWR. Average rates a=
re=20
to increase 3c/kWh.  Further the AB1x  1 c/kWh is to continue.   Thus, the=
=20
total increase, relative to rates in effect in year 2000,  is 4 c/kWh=20
($40/MWh). Lynch was very unclear how this rate would be implemented for=20
residential customers (a tiering proposal will be heard separately and take=
=20
30-45 days to implement).  One of these decisions addresses how to measure=
=20
past undercollections but as far as rate increases go, they are to cover on=
ly=20
going forward costs.
2) One decision addresses QF issues.  I have not seen the PD (It is expecte=
d=20
out shortly).  The Wood PD revises his revised PD of last week (yes, a=20
revised, revised PD) as follows:
a) Requires QFs to be paid on a going forward basis (as of 4/1/01). Utiliti=
es=20
to pay within 15 days upon presentation of an invoice.  No help for past du=
e=20
amounts, however.
b) Change the SRAC energy index from Topock to Malin.  Such a change will=
=20
lower the SRAC energy by =01&4 c/kWh=018.  This is a 15% to 25% hit to SRAC=
=20
relative to the status quo, which is based more or entirely on Topock.
c) Calls for workshops to further refine the gas basis for SRAC and address=
=20
other factors in the SRAC formula such as heat rates and O&M factors=20
d) Works with Section 390, as is, does not depend on a legislative change
i) Thus the reason why SRAC is based upon a border price index.
e) Overall cap (i.e. 7.9 c/kWh) is dropped.
The fourth decision addresses an investigation of the utility holding=20
companies.  Basically the CPUC is going after utility holding companies for=
=20
funds to reduce the past undercollections.

Further Notes taken by Sue Mara during the press conference:

Lynch and Wood Running the meeting

Lynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for hi=
gh=20
prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package. =
=20
Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is=
=20
34%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen=20
continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=
ts=20
-- this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care o=
f=20
in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=20
Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.=
=20
Wants new appointments to FERC from the states -- ""our cries have fallen on=
=20
deaf ears""

Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:

1.  Wood's proposal -- modified -- Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning=
=20
4/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 39=
0=20
(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas inde=
x=20
from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, wher=
e=20
prices have been more stable.

2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment -- Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for=
=20
purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for=
=20
purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the=
=20
payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for=
=20
California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than th=
e=20
proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,=20
however.

3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=
.=20
(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge=20
permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers=
=20
ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers=
=20
with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase=
,=20
get a 9 % increase -- the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's=20
accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Tak=
es=20
IOUs 30-45 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding=
=20
during that time period (see # 5).

4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=
e=20
if it is best for the public utilities.

A new proceeding was also identified.

5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate=20
structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use) =
=20
Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided=
=20
it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above =
--=20
would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30- 45 days.

In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=
o=20
after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.

I'm still listening.

I have not seen the PD (It is expecte=d=20out shortly).  The Wood PD revises his revised PD of last week (yes, a=20revised, revised PD) as follows:a) Requires QFs to be paid on a going forward basis (as of 4/1/01). Utiliti=es=20to pay within 15 days upon presentation of an invoice.  No help for past du=e=20amounts, however.b) Change the SRAC energy index from Topock to Malin.  Such a change will==20lower the SRAC energy by =01&4 c/kWh=018.  This is a 15% to 25% hit to SRAC==20relative to the status quo, which is based more or entirely on Topock.c) Calls for workshops to further refine the gas basis for SRAC and address==20other factors in the SRAC formula such as heat rates and O&M factors=20d) Works with Section 390, as is, does not depend on a legislative changei) Thus the reason why SRAC is based upon a border price index.e) Overall cap (i.e. 7.9 c/kWh) is dropped.The fourth decision addresses an investigation of the utility holding=20companies.  Basically the CPUC is going after utility holding companies for==20funds to reduce the past undercollections.Alan ComnesFurther Notes taken by Sue Mara during the press conference:Lynch and Wood Running the meetingLynch started out castigating FERC for the ""failure to act"", sellers for hi=gh=20prices forcing CA into this action.  Has some charts in the press package. ==20Talked about how wonderful the Govs proposals have been.  Said net short is==2034%.  Sellers ""have us over a barrell"" for those sales.  Attorney Gen=20continues investigation of the sellers. These are all for going forward cos=ts=20 this doesn't address the ""$ for the hot dog, which is being taken care o=f=20in Sacramento.""  She said these proposals ensure reliability and allow=20Treasurer to issue bonds.  Continues to castigate FERC throughout the call.==20Wants new appointments to FERC from the states  ""our cries have fallen on==20deaf ears""Lynch announced the following votes for tomorrow:1.  Wood's proposal  modified  Order the IOUs to pay the QFs beginning==204/1 on a going forward basis only.  Modified existing formula in Section 39=0=20(Legislative change to this section did not pass yet).  Shifts the gas inde=x=20from Topoc (where Wood says the prices are being mnipulated) to Malin, wher=e=20prices have been more stable.2. Sets the CA Procurement Adjustment  Orders the IOUs to pay the DWR for==20purchases.  At one point she said that the order would be for all power for==20purchased by the state beginning Jan 19; at another point she said that the==20payments are for going forward costs. ""It's time to pay the power bills for==20California.""  CPA calculated based on the ""residual"" method, rather than th=e=20proportional method.  Payments to DWR made on the proportional method,=20however.3.  Lynch alternate setting a 3 cents/kWh increase in accordance with AB 1X=.=20(The ALJ decision said no rate increase.) Makes the 1 cent temp charge=20permanent (didn't say if its additive with the 3 cents) Believe this covers==20ALL needs on a going forward basis.  According to  ABX 1, small customers==20with 130% over baseline get no increase, small customers with 200% increase=,=20get a 9 % increase  the rest get socked, I guess.  Adopted TURN's=20accounting proposal.  Will look at rate design in a future proceeding.  Tak=es=20IOUs 3045 days to charge the rates; will conduct a rate design proceeding==20during that time period (see # 5).4. Orders an investigation into the Utility holding company structure to se=e=20if it is best for the public utilities.A new proceeding was also identified.5.  Lynch is issuing an Assigned Comissioner ruling proposing a new rate=20structure. (I presume to have rates that increase greatly with more use) ==20Need information from DWR to calculate rates and DWR has not yet provided==20it.  Described the need to have a record on this. As mentioned in #3 above ==20would expect this to be comepled with a decision in 30 45 days.In one of the above orders, Lynch said that she orders the utililities to g=o=20after sellers using all legal means for the unjust and unreasonable prices.I'm still listening.Sue MaraEnron Corp.Tel: (415) 7827802Fax:(415) 7827854","['alan.comnes@enron.com', 'tim.belden@enron.com', 'mike.swerzbin@enron.com', 'michael.driscoll@enron.com', 'matt.motley@enron.com', 'robert.badeer@enron.com', 'diana.scholtes@enron.com', 'sean.crandall@enron.com', 'chris.mallory@enron.com', 'jeff.richter@enron.com', 'tom.alonso@enron.com', 'mark.fischer@enron.com', 'phillip.platter@enron.com', 'carla.hoffman@enron.com', 'christopher.calger@enron.com', 'michael.etringer@enron.com', 'steve.hall@enron.com', 'christian.yoder@enron.com', 'tim.heizenrader@enron.com', 'stephen.swain@enron.com', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com', 'susan.mara@enron.com', 'joe.hartsoe@enron.com', 'ray.alvarez@enron.com', 'gray.calvert@enron.com', 'chris.foster@enron.com', 'greg.wolfe@enron.com', 'tim.belden@enron.com', 'mike.swerzbin@enron.com', 'michael.driscoll@enron.com', 'matt.motley@enron.com', 'robert.badeer@enron.com', 'diana.scholtes@enron.com', 'sean.crandall@enron.com', 'chris.mallory@enron.com', 'jeff.richter@enron.com', 'tom.alonso@enron.com', 'mark.fischer@enron.com', 'phillip.platter@enron.com', 'carla.hoffman@enron.com', 'christopher.calger@enron.com', 'michael.etringer@enron.com', 'steve.hall@enron.com', 'christian.yoder@enron.com', 'tim.heizenrader@enron.com', 'stephen.swain@enron.com', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com', 'susan.mara@enron.com', 'joe.hartsoe@enron.com', 'ray.alvarez@enron.com', 'gray.calvert@enron.com', 'chris.foster@enron.com', 'greg.wolfe@enron.com']",53

Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.  It seems we have items 
of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield 
which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action 
team did not know when the action items were prepared.  The action dates are 
approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification 
on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the 
responsibility of Koch for some of the items.  Ed, the attorney for EOTT,  
will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.  If 
this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I.....

Summary of Customer Comments and Southern's Responsive Proposals
Docket No. RP00-476

I.  OFOs AND PENALTIES

Comment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs
including information that will help customers better understand operational
situation being addressed

Response:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance
of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a
mutually agreeable basis

Comment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;
$7.50 is more reasonable

Response:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing to
decrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.

Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency Mode
OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons:
- Customers need more time to make adjustments
o Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFO
is already in place
o 12 hours notice would be more appropriate
- Limit application to abusive shipper behavior
- Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day
and not intraday
- Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too
late, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle
- Justify adding the gas price to the penalty
- The increased penalty price is really an increase in
imbalance charges without other benefits
- Use Gas Daily's ""Midpoint Louisiana - Onshore South"" daily
index price instead of the one proposed

Response:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to make
the following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO.
- Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of
the gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLY
if a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;
telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency.
- Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth
in Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willing
to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,
so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will
be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific
offenders whenever possible.
- SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a
gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change
in conditions.
- Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start
of a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on the
Intraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT.
- At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons its
penalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) are
needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system.

Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a group
being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point

Response:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how the
proposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipper-specific
penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within
tolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.


II.  SEGMENTATION

Comment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by
rate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide more
segmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.

Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated
two ""long line"" segments of its pipeline along which it could allow
intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,
SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this
model.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, the
program would have the following attributes:
- SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but will
layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along
identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm
capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  For
example, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can do
intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system
through zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system.
- On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, the
shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the
nominations do not overlap along the long line segment.
- The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries
for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.
This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first delivery
point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,
but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipt-to-delivery
combinations.
- Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery
would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping
segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate.
- SNG is in the process of determining the programming
requirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide an
estimate at the meeting.

III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY

Comment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release
deals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southern
has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,
non-biddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keep
biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely
Nomination Cycle.)

Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additional
options under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,
to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening
Nomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity
releases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to
offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.

Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon
as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.

Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as the
programming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of the
implementation date.

Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FT-NN service on a no-notice
basis as soon as possible.

Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process of
programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,
2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in mid-January 2001, and
will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December
2000.

IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Comment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to trade
imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election
deadline.

Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,
Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers
17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and
to complete the trades.

Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISS
storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.

Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase the
level of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to add
this option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose
storage account is used to resolve the imbalance.

Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser
of operational or actual data.

Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance
percentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentage
and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  On
the overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fills
up a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing
IT overrun.

Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expenses
incurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.

Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out
and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at
the meeting.

Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to
the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved
with storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern should
go further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalance
resolved through storage.

Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and
equitable for the reasons given in its filing.

Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate
delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the
discount.

Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue to
apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations on
the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as
part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.

OFOs AND PENALTIESComment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOsincluding information that will help customers better understand operationalsituation being addressedResponse:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advanceof OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on amutually agreeable basisComment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;$7.50 is more reasonableResponse:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing todecrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency ModeOFO is unreasonable for the following reasons: Customers need more time to make adjustmentso Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFOis already in placeo 12 hours notice would be more appropriate Limit application to abusive shipper behavior Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas dayand not intraday Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented toolate, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle Justify adding the gas price to the penalty The increased penalty price is really an increase inimbalance charges without other benefits Use Gas Daily's ""Midpoint Louisiana  Onshore South"" dailyindex price instead of the one proposedResponse:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to makethe following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO. Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start ofthe gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLYif a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency. Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forthin Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willingto repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty willbe targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specificoffenders whenever possible. SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of agas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a changein conditions. Since advance notice must always be given prior to the startof a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on theIntraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT. At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons itspenalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) areneeded to preserve the operational integrity of the system.Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a groupbeing penalized even if it is within tolerance at a pointResponse:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how theproposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipperspecificpenalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is withintolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.II.  SEGMENTATIONComment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity byrate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide moresegmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolatedtwo ""long line"" segments of its pipeline along which it could allowintrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to thismodel.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, theprogram would have the following attributes: SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but willlayer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment alongidentified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firmcapacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  Forexample, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can dointrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north systemthrough zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system. On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, theshipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as thenominations do not overlap along the long line segment. The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveriesfor the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first deliverypoint being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipttodeliverycombinations. Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented deliverywould have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlappingsegments and qualify for the FT commodity rate. SNG is in the process of determining the programmingrequirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide anestimate at the meeting.III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITYComment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity releasedeals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southernhas offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,nonbiddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keepbiddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the TimelyNomination Cycle.)Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additionaloptions under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the EveningNomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacityreleases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved tooffer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soonas possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as theprogramming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of theimplementation date.Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FTNN service on a nonoticebasis as soon as possible.Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process ofprogramming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in midJanuary 2001, andwill host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December2000.IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMSComment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to tradeimbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the electiondeadline.Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances andto complete the trades.Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISSstorage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase thelevel of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to addthis option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whosestorage account is used to resolve the imbalance.Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesserof operational or actual data.Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalancepercentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentageand uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  Onthe overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fillsup a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billingIT overrun.Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expensesincurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash outand will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account atthe meeting.Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition tothe collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolvedwith storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern shouldgo further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalanceresolved through storage.Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable andequitable for the reasons given in its filing.Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternatedelivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving thediscount.Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue toapply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations onthe applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to aspart of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.[THIS DOCUMENT IS PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL AND INTENDED FOR SETTLEMENTDISCUSSIONS ONLY.

Ose puts the blame where it belongs by pointing out that the ISO's favoritism towards DWR cost California billions in potential refunds.


ISO's role in sales is rapped: Critics challenge the independence of the power grid operator.
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published Aug. 3, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- The independence of California's power transmission grid operator and its electricity sales to the state Department of Water Resources came under fire at a House of Representatives hearing Thursday. 
But grid operators said there was no way that arms-length transactions with the Department of Water Resources could have been negotiated beginning in January when power blackouts were imminent and the state was the only buyer with money. 
Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, chairman of the House Governmental Affairs energy policy panel, charged in a prepared statement to open the hearing that the cozy relationship between the DWR and the California Independent System Operator could result in the state forfeiting any claim to refunds for overcharges by power generators. 
""The state's interference into Cal-ISO has possibly cost Californians billions of dollars in potential refunds,"" Ose said. ""Moreover, it represents a serious violation of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations."" 
At issue is the fact that the ISO is run by a five-person board appointed by the governor when, under federal law, it is supposed to be independent. Additionally, the ISO's biggest customer is the DWR, which buys power using state money to firm up power deliveries by utilities too cash-starved to buy it themselves. 
Last week, the FERC determined that the DWR would not be entitled to any rate refunds on its power contracts. In reaching that decision, the commission cited the agency's special access to information that gave it a competitive advantage over other purchasers. 
Terry M. Winter, ISO president and chief executive officer, said that at the time the Department of Water Resources began buying power in January under these unusual circumstances, there were no other buyers willing to step in to keep power flowing to homes and businesses. 
""That occurred because the market was not functioning,"" Winter said. ""They were the only creditworthy purchaser purchasing power."" 
But Kevin Madden, the regulatory commission's top lawyer, said the relationship between the ISO and the Department of Water Resources raises troubling questions. 
""DWR buying on behalf of the state is a market participant,"" he said. ""It shouldn't be in the ISO control room. It shouldn't be allowed to cherry pick"" among power sellers. 
Madden said he expects the commission to rule soon on whether the ISO should be reconstituted to ensure its independence.

In response to the email distributed last  Fridayregarding IEP's intervention 
in the EOB and CALPX price cap filings at  FERC, IEP is proceeding to draft 
comments on the EOB filing.? Much of the  filing will build off arguements 
used in the San Diego pleading as well as  comments IEP made to the 
Congressional Subcommittee meetings in San  Diego.? In addition, IEP has 
intervened for ""party status"" in the CALPX  proceeding on price caps.? 
?
We plan to distrubute comments on  Thursday, convene a conference call 
Friday, Sept. 15 at 10:00 a.m.  (PST).
?
The Call-In Number is???  ??? ??? 800/205-3434
The Participant Code  is?????????  111756
?
IEP is still interested in receiving Task Force  commitments to assist in 
restructuring/transmission related matters.?  While a numberr of companies 
have indicated verbally their interest in the EOB  filing as well as others, 
we have yet to receive a written confirmation.?  If you are interested, 
please respond to the Friday email soliciting  funds.? Thanks.

**IMPORTANT**

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.

Scott

Dear Market Participants,

Please note the changes below are planned for the indicated
OASIS/MIS/CSS systems on the dates shown.  Updates and revisions
will follow as needed to keep you informed.
Please direct any questions or comments back to me.

Thank you,

##################################################################
Scheduled for 11/29/00 & 11/30/00
Change type - Enhancement
Description:
Billing System changes will be deployed to implement 10 minute,
non-synchronous and 10 minute, spinning lost opportunity payments.

Also, billing software deployment to allow PURPA Class 2 units to
participate in the LBMP market and not have their transactions
adjusted after the fact.

MIS change will enable web posting (via Operational Announcement)
in the event of a reserve pick-up.

SCUC and BME software modifications will include the following:
- SCUC modeling of Gas Turbines as zero cost capacity resources in
  the Forecast Load Commitment Passes of SCUC.
- SCUC and BME pro-rata scheduling of external transactions with
  equal bids in the event multiple transactions are marginal.
- SCUC and BME non-distributed scheduling of reserve suppliers in
  the event multiple suppliers are marginal.

Subject: CGAS storage/exchange deal tickets for Nov-Mar

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange


I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.

Shirley,

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

 

Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director - Research

ENRON



Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be 
appreciated.

Hi Guys,

I still have not confirmed anything with the old Biddy's team so I suggest
if you are interested in getting some soccer in over the weekend as I do.
Check out the scrimmage Keith found at the Washington Park soccer field on
Sunday at 11.  He says its open and ok for us to take part. The field is
close to but South of the Rose Garden, Trolley Station and closest too but
down hill from the kids playground.  To get there from the Rose Garden take
the Road to the left which brings you back into SW Portland.  Hope to see
you there.

Jon

Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

Jon

Green Roomers,

Declan has informed me of the following info...

""Brad said that Biddys have a practice game every Sunday at 1pm at the high
school
just off 30th and Powell (Cleveland High I think).  They would like us to
practice with them each week.""

Let's plan on fielding a team each Sunday at 1:00 to play the old Biddy's
team.   Should be a good way to stay in shape and organized as a team. Hope
to see you there on Sunday and if any other news comes up I will drop you a
line. 

Jon

Green Roomies,

We are registered for fall outdoor soccer in the 1st division. In first
division we'll have our work cut out for us but I think we'll do fine and
have fun.  The first game is Sept. 9th at 12:00 with 9 more games each week
thereafter.   I do not know the locations yet but will get that out as soon
as I do.  Many have suggested the need to practice to be competitive in the
1st division so we need to set a practice schedule.  How do Tuesday and
Thursday nights look for you guys?  We also need a field we can count
on....Ideas anyone?  In the meantime we all need to be keeping our fitness
in mind...running twice a week 4-6 miles would be a good start.  If we can
hit the fall season in good shape and well organized I am sure we'll be a
very competitive 1st division team.  I have been paid by Mike Z., Kevin,
Adam, Scott, Jon B., Mike B., Jay, Justin, Declan, Tristan, and Jacob.  The
rest of you still need to mail $50 to Jon Gail 8573 SW Dakota Drive,
Tualatin OR 97062 if you want to play.  Again please send me your
suggestions regarding practice fields and let me know if you have any
questions.  Later,

Jon Gail, Manager

Ozzie,

I want to retain the option of keeping Alamac (create a control area), and 
selling New Albany.   From a desk perspective, retaining at least one control 
area is strategically important, and if I can sell New Albany for $175 
million and keep Alamac for $20-30 million, we may want to do that.   

Given the strength in the long term gas market ($4.50 - 5.25/MMBtu over a 15 
year period), it is much easier to hedge the forward value of a coal plant.   
On  the other hand, peakers are literally worth zero on a forward basis, 
given low heat rate forward pricing.

Can we remove AIG from the middle, if necessary?

Gas Pains

With the latest weather forecasts revising temperatures upward from the
Arctic blast predicted on Tuesday and hydropower in the Northwest remaining
strong, peak power prices for Friday and Saturday delivery generally fell
modestly across the WSCC.  ""There's simply no strength in the market right
now, with flows and generation as strong as they are, temperatures so high
and gas prices so low,"" explained one hair-pulling marketer.  Meanwhile,
market pundits across the region were on the edges of their seats awaiting
news from Weil, Gotshal & Manges on who cast the winning bid for Enron's
energy trading business, once considered the jewel in the ex-giant's crown.
However, the announcement had not been made as of this writing.  The law
firm was scheduled to announce the winning bid on Thursday from their New
York offices.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub futures lost ground for the
second day in a row despite the AGA's bullish natural gas inventory report
released Wednesday.  The front month contract lost 4.3 cents to close at
2.185$/mmBtu, while the March contract fell 3.7 cents to close at
2.195$/mmBtu.  Both contracts were trading higher early, but came down in
late trading under a rash of short selling.  ""Everyone's trying to keep
their positions very short on this one, with all the uncertainty around,""
explained one analyst.  ""Prices could fall to as low as 2$/mmBtu before
long.""

Heavy load power at Mid-Columbia was the cheapest in the West on Thursday,
with deals ranging from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high
end.  ""Now that the brunt of the cold front is going to miss us, the bottom
is falling out of the market again,"" ventured one stoic player.  The
five-day forecast called for temperatures to remain above normal through
Saturday, followed by cooling to near-normal temperatures through January
14.  The latest six-to-ten called for cooling to below normal temperatures
from January 16 to 20.  Flows at Chief Joseph remained healthy, and were
even revised slightly upward for the coming week on forecasts of rain and
snow showers, with Friday coming in at 65 kcfs, Saturday at 60 kcfs, Sunday
at 50 kcfs, Monday coming up to 95 kcfs, and 90 kcfs through next Thursday.
There were no new unit outages to report on with certainty on Thursday, but
there were murmurings in the Northwest that Colstrip #3 (686 MW) had joined
its sister unit #4 (700 MW) off-line. No confirmation was available.

As weather forecasts continued to call for near-normal temperatures through
Monday and spot gas prices at the Socal border stayed steady, power prices
for the Friday/Saturday package softened in the Golden State on Thursday.
Peak power at SP15 traded between 18 and 20.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done in the 19s, while the off-peak product changed hands from 14 to 15.25.
In political news, California's Attorney General filed a civil suit against
PG&E Corp on Thursday, seeking $600 million to $4 billion in damages.  The
state alleged PG&E Corp. received substantial, unwarranted cash flows over
the past 4 years from its subsidiary PG&E, and finally did nothing to
prevent the utility from falling into bankruptcy last year.  For their part,
PG&E Corp said CPUC auditors had thoroughly reviewed their transactions with
their subsidiary and found nothing fraudulent.  On the generation front,
Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was almost at full power on Thursday, operating at
690 MW.  Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) exited the grid for planned maintenance.
Friday forecasts called for high temperatures to the reach the mid-50s in
Sacramento, the low-60s in the Bay area, and the low-70s at southern load
centers.  Little change was seen in the forecast through Monday of the new
week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
January 16 to 20.

The Southwest, locked in the grips of a heat wave pushing temperatures into
the 70s in Phoenix, posted moderate decreases in peak power prices for the
Friday-Saturday package.  Goods at Palo Verde changed hands from 17 to
19.75$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high end.  Many marketers reported
very light trading at other hubs in the region, such as Four Corners and
Mona.  The five-day forecast put temperatures in above-normal territory
through January 14 in the desert region, with some cooling outside of the
desert on Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted continuing near- to
slightly below-normal temperatures from January 16 through 20.  In unit
news, coal juggernaut Four Corners #5 (750 MW), which was scheduled for a
maintenance outage on January 15, tripped off-line late Wednesday with a
condenser tube leak.  Plant operators decided that no attempt would be made
to repair the leak and place the unit back on-line before the scheduled
maintenance, so the ETR will be near March 14, 2002.  Fellow coal-smoker
Coronado #1 (365 MW) missed its January 9 ETR yesterday.  The new estimated
date of return is sometime in the evening on January 11.

___________________________________________________________
As temperatures continued their climb and gas held steady, day-ahead and
near-term contract electricity prices declined again across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  ""Peak power at most hubs was solidly in the
teens, which wasn't surprising with fundamentals so bearish,"" commented one
unfazed southeastern trader.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were up
for much of the day, but fell late and ended down.  The front-month contract
settled 4.3 cents lower to close at 2.185$/mmBtu, while March shed 3.7 cents
to end at 2.195$/mmBtu.

Amid mild spring-like temperatures and much lower real-time prices, heavy
load energy costs slipped further on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic.  Western
PJM goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.75 and 23.05$/MWh,
shedding 0.55$/MWh on the high end, but firming up a quarter on the low.  In
unit news, traders said Conemaugh #2 (850 MW) probably returned to service
on Thursday, while a Keystone unit (850 MW) was off-line and expected to
remain that way through the weekend.  Temperatures were expected to edge
slightly lower on Friday, with highs in the 49 to 52 degree range.  A
further 5 degree decline was expected on Saturday, and temperatures were
expected to remain there through the first day of the new week.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 16 to
20.

Peak power prices slumped for the third day in a row in the Midwest on
Thursday as weak weather-related demand and healthy generation kept hopes of
an upside in the daily market unrealized.  Into Cinergy day-ahead deals were
done between 15.75 and 19.75$/MWh, with most trades below the 19$/MWh mark.
Balance of January was heard trading around 20.5$/MWh, and the February
contract saw action from 21.05 to 21.25.  While forecasts called for about 5
degrees of cooling on Friday, the outlook through Monday predicted
temperatures to remain well above normal for this time of year, with lows in
the upper-20s to low-30s and highs in the upper-30s to mid-40s.  The latest
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

As the mercury rose and spot gas made incremental gains, heavy load
electricity prices in the Southeast continued to fall on Thursday.  Into
Entergy goods were bought and sold between 15 and 19$/MWh, losing a painful
4$/MWh off both ends.  Into TVA prices also took a hit on Thursday, with
daily trades heard between 16.5 and 18.25$/MWh.  No new outages were
reported for the SERC region.  Temperatures were expected to reach highs in
the upper-50s and low-60s on Friday, with overnight lows mostly in the
upper-40s.  Highs were expected to cool off into the mid-50s for the weekend
and first day of the new week.  The latest six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

All,

FYI, here is the latest draft of their business plan for your review and 
commentary.  I had the video call yesterday and went through all the org 
changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious 
reasons.

Subject: Re: Draft Business Plan Enron Net Works South America  


I think there are 2 principal drivers:

(1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or 
elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that we 
have a  mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification 
vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of 
Bastos - I for one would like  to get a clear and substantive understanding 
in regard to his trading background, priority for physical vs. financial 
products, and expectations ) and
(2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more 
aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic 
and   functional for each of  the Business Units

Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will 
establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward.  

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly 
call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much 
appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron 
employees ""outside""of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all 
around.

Mike,

Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America. Due 
to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to review.

As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to 
streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There 
appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is 
responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my roles, 
including the need to channel information through us into and out of the 
region.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks, Steve

Gerald:

I have reviewed the documents, and I only have a few proposed changes.  

On the responses indicating that Brickhill is providing, I would add ""on 
behalf of the Chicago Project Shipper Group"" at the end of each response.  
That would clarify that he is not answering individually for ENA.  We can ask 
Doug or Kim about this on the conference call.  In fact, we might not even 
need to include those questions where Brickhill is providing the answers.

If you haven't already caught it, on response #20 to Pan Alberta/PAGUS, the 
left margin is not right (at least on my copy).

On response 4 to NGPL, I would change the response to ""Enron North America is 
not providing a reponse to this data request.  Please see objection of the 
Chicago Project Shippers Group dated May 10, 2000.""

On responses 7, 11, and 13, change the last word to ""analyses"".

On response 11, fix the unnecessary hyphen in ""(opera-tionally, . . . ""

When you have the final reports from Juanita, I would like to take a look at 
the finished product before we send it to Doug and Kim.

Thanks.

The following justification is intended to support potential deDASR decision 
for SDG&E service territory accounts.

For Bundled Contracts (EES & EEMC), EES is responsible for managing all 
components of the customers bundled bill except taxes.  Such components 
include energy and all UDC related charge components (CTC, post-transition 
period CTC, transmission, distribution, nuclear decommissioning costs and 
public purpose programs, i.e. the CA fully bundled bill).  Enron has 
leveraged its risk management skills to manage the risks associated with the 
regulatory risk embedded within its retail contracts.  The discount off 
tariff product provides the Enron customer with certainty regarding the 
magnitude and duration of savings derived from deregulation in California.  
These contracts span the AB1890 transition period and typically brought 
expected deregulation savings forward for the customer and levelized the 
savings over the contract term.  EES hedges its risk by buying Energy in the 
same manner as the Utilities during the transition period and locking in 
supply at fixed prices when customers are exposed to full spot market prices. 
 During the regulated AB1890 transition period, the utilities pay ESPs a PX 
credit equal to the fully bundled tariff price minus the avoided cost of 
energy procurement (the PX-credit).  EES hedges the T&D, and CTC regulatory 
risk though a variety of hedging activities including interest rate swaps, 
development of bundled service index products, electric commodity and other 
fuel related hedging activities and intervention in Utility regulatory 
proceedings on behalf of our bundled service customer base.  The ability to 
source from the UDC is implicit within any contract that transfers the price 
risk for all commodity and UDC-related (non-commodity) costs to Enron.  In 
February, 2001 Enron chose to resource its supply for its SCE and PG&E 
locations from the host Utility.  This resourcing decision was necessary as a 
result of :  a) PG&E/SCE non-compliance with the AB1890 tariffs (Rule 22), b) 
the demise of the California PX and lack of a liquid hourly market necessary 
to follow a retail customer load shape and c)  to protect our retail customer 
base against potential discriminatory treatment upon their return to Utility 
Service upon expiration of their Enron retail energy service contract.

Current legislation is now pending that may again provide regulated bundled 
service rates for SDG&E customers.  This legislation has the potential to 
provide for the discriminatory treatment of direct access service customers 
upon their return to Utility default service at the expiration of their DA 
contract term.  Upon passage of such legislation, it is imperative that 
bundled service and direct access customers continue to be treated in a 
comparable manner.  This was a fundamental principle of California 
deregulation.  The passage of such legislation, would result in the continued 
need for SDG&E to calculate a PX credit associated with energy deliveries by 
third party ESPs.  Under AB1890, the credit is equal to the fully bundled 
contract price minus the spot market value of the energy plus associated 
delivery costs imposed on the Schedule Coordinator.  The energy only portion 
of the SDG&E customer bill has continued to be calculated and posted on the 
SDG&E ESP website even after the suspension of the SDG&E rate freeze in July, 
1999.  New legislation with a fixed generation rate applicable to SDG&E 
bundled service customers which allowed for collection of resulting UDC 
undercollections in future time periods from all customers (including 
existing DA customers who later return to UDC bundled service) essentially 
constitutes a return to the AB1890 transition period mechanism for SDG&E.  
Such legislation may also prevent the establishment of critical mass 
necessary to support development of a liquid hourly market within California 
necessary to follow a retail customers load shape without the existence of 
the PX.  In the event of such a reregulation rate freeze, AB1890 and the 
existing SDG&E tariffs should also make SDG&E liable for such ""PX-Credits"" to 
ESPs who have entering into bilateral Bundled Service contracts under the 
AB1890.  In the event that the rules, tariffs or legislation are modified to 
no longer provide for such PX-credits, EES could preserve the commercial 
practicality of its CA Bundled Service Contracts by resourcing its supply for 
EES/EEMC customers located within SDG&E service territory directly from SDG&E.

Such components include energy and all UDC related charge components (CTC, posttransition period CTC, transmission, distribution, nuclear decommissioning costs and public purpose programs, i.e. the CA fully bundled bill).  Enron has leveraged its risk management skills to manage the risks associated with the regulatory risk embedded within its retail contracts.  The discount off tariff product provides the Enron customer with certainty regarding the magnitude and duration of savings derived from deregulation in California.  These contracts span the AB1890 transition period and typically brought expected deregulation savings forward for the customer and levelized the savings over the contract term.  EES hedges its risk by buying Energy in the same manner as the Utilities during the transition period and locking in supply at fixed prices when customers are exposed to full spot market prices.  During the regulated AB1890 transition period, the utilities pay ESPs a PX credit equal to the fully bundled tariff price minus the avoided cost of energy procurement (the PXcredit).  EES hedges the T&D, and CTC regulatory risk though a variety of hedging activities including interest rate swaps, development of bundled service index products, electric commodity and other fuel related hedging activities and intervention in Utility regulatory proceedings on behalf of our bundled service customer base.  The ability to source from the UDC is implicit within any contract that transfers the price risk for all commodity and UDCrelated (noncommodity) costs to Enron.  In February, 2001 Enron chose to resource its supply for its SCE and PG&E locations from the host Utility.  This resourcing decision was necessary as a result of :  a) PG&E/SCE noncompliance with the AB1890 tariffs (Rule 22), b) the demise of the California PX and lack of a liquid hourly market necessary to follow a retail customer load shape and c)  to protect our retail customer base against potential discriminatory treatment upon their return to Utility Service upon expiration of their Enron retail energy service contract.Current legislation is now pending that may again provide regulated bundled service rates for SDG&E customers.  This legislation has the potential to provide for the discriminatory treatment of direct access service customers upon their return to Utility default service at the expiration of their DA contract term.  Upon passage of such legislation, it is imperative that bundled service and direct access customers continue to be treated in a comparable manner.  This was a fundamental principle of California deregulation.  The passage of such legislation, would result in the continued need for SDG&E to calculate a PX credit associated with energy deliveries by third party ESPs.  Under AB1890, the credit is equal to the fully bundled contract price minus the spot market value of the energy plus associated delivery costs imposed on the Schedule Coordinator.  The energy only portion of the SDG&E customer bill has continued to be calculated and posted on the SDG&E ESP website even after the suspension of the SDG&E rate freeze in July, 1999.  New legislation with a fixed generation rate applicable to SDG&E bundled service customers which allowed for collection of resulting UDC undercollections in future time periods from all customers (including existing DA customers who later return to UDC bundled service) essentially constitutes a return to the AB1890 transition period mechanism for SDG&E.  Such legislation may also prevent the establishment of critical mass necessary to support development of a liquid hourly market within California necessary to follow a retail customers load shape without the existence of the PX.  In the event of such a reregulation rate freeze, AB1890 and the existing SDG&E tariffs should also make SDG&E liable for such ""PXCredits"" to ESPs who have entering into bilateral Bundled Service contracts under the AB1890.  In the event that the rules, tariffs or legislation are modified to no longer provide for such PXcredits, EES could preserve the commercial practicality of its CA Bundled Service Contracts by resourcing its supply for EES/EEMC customers located within SDG&E service territory directly from SDG&E.","['mike.smith@enron.com', 'jeff.messina@enron.com', 'evan.hughes@enron.com', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com', 'marty.sunde@enron.com', 'jeff.messina@enron.com', 'evan.hughes@enron.com', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com', 'marty.sunde@enron.com']",9

Subject: Critical Tornedo Meetings on Wednesday/Thursday

There will be meetings in Houston at Enron to discuss the new draft of the 
Offering Memo and the To Do Checklist as follows:
1.  Wednesday, August 25th, 2pm-7pm, in EB2868; and
2.  Thursday, August 26th, 8AM-10:30AM in EB 27c1, and continuing after 
10:30AM in EB2868.

The Wednesday afternoon meeting is the MOST CRITICAL because Larry, John 
Osborne of Skadden, and a few others are only available to meet on Wednesday. 
Please make every effort to attend.  In addition, please review prior to the 
meeting not only the revised OM, but also the checklist, a revised version of 
which will be distributed later today to include Bob Baird's and my addition 
thoughts.

For those flying in from NYC, when you reach the Enron Building, please have 
Enron Security call Larry's assistant, Kim Zachery, at 853-1971, who will 
meet you on the 28th floor.  In her absence, please have Security contact my 
assistant, Chaundra Woods, at 345-7621.

i think thats rite -think curve flattens somewhat.back end the overvalued
part for now. i think we more consolidate sideways choppy for a few sessions
but if the present  rate of injections continue the end users/utilties will
have to stop buying cuz of real phys limitations to take the gas into
storage. funds short but only 6% of open int and have covered later part of
last week.
  think vol comes in again too.i think it sale 4.50 scale up-talked to some
others to o thinking it cant go below 4.00 so i actually think more the
suprise in the short term for a break of 4.00!! so who knows/cud work the
other way.
   agree-disappointed at lack of producer selling-we had one deal come thur
but its been worked for months so not price relevant.
  when are you in town next?

most bullish thing at this point is moving closer to everyone's
psychological $4 price target and that everybody and their dog is still
short.  next sellers need to be from producer community.  saw a little this
week with williams hedging the barrett transaction but wouldnt say thats
indicative of the rest of the e&p community.  short covering rallies will
get more common here.  velocity of move down has slowed significantly for
good (except maybe in bid week).  my concern is if we go to $4 and people
want to cover some shorts, who's selling it to them?  might feel a lot like
it did when we were trying to break $5.

Here is the information you requested on Canfibre.  This is the Power

Randy Petersen, VP in our Underwriting Group, is meeting with CanFibre 
tomorrow afternoon (Wed. Feb 9th).  He has asked if we can pull together the 
outstanding A/R amounts, date invoiced, and any other pertinent information 
he can take with him to the meeting.

Can you gather this information Wednesday morning and let me know when that 
will be available?

Thanks,
Tracy

Kevin:

I work in Portland in West Power tradng and have day-to-day responsibility 
for managing the Can Fibre account.  Since this deal started in Sept. they 
have only paid one invoice and that was paid 16 days late.  They are 
currently 57 days late on one outstanding invoice and 29 days late on 
another.  They have failed to come up with $ despite two ""heart-to-heart"" 
discussions with Dale Hrcak about this issue.  Stone and Webster, the firm 
building their Riverside plant, I guess controls the cash during this 
start-up period and Dale cannot get them to release funds.  They seem 
disorganized and fail to give us straight answers on when we will be paid.  
If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and 
legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should 
take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake 
Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me 
a call at 503/464-3822 and give me uyour thoughts? 

Thanks!

Chris

If Enron did not own a piece of this company I would be talking to credit and legal about whether or not Can Fibre is in default and what steps we should take to require collateral and/or termiante this agreement.  Instead, Jake Thomas indicated that I should talk to you re: next steps. Could you give me a call at 503/4643822 and give me uyour thoughts? Thanks!Chris",['christian.yoder@enron.com'],1

For those who follow European developments, some of these slides show how 
Enron's settled (not just physical) volumes stack up against other big 
European players (their numbers are probably just physical).   mcs

Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other 
jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program:

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for 
traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary.

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is 
being scheduled in Houston and Calgary.

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but 
needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs 
to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local 
power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A 
meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.

Can we grant him guest access to EOL again? He is he same 
person who requested it a few weeks ago. Evidently he was busy

Dear Vince,

I hope your trip to Australia was successful. It's one of my favorite places
to go.

I've copied you on the email to Mike initiating Enron's trial service to
Energycast. Thanks for helping to set this up.

Would you ask the authorities in Enron to refresh my access to Enrononline?
My Guest User ID as ENA61296 and my guest password was TR84BY13. They no
longer work, probably because I haven't visited the site in months as we
were in full development mode on Energycast.

Vince, you will note in our website references to forward prices of power in
Nepool, NYPP, and PJM. We use Reuters as a reference -- not satisfactory. If
your traders like Energycast and Enron became a client, would Enron consider
linking its prices to our site? We have to improve over the Reuters quotes
and regard Enrononline or Bloomberg as the best candidates. Over time, as
our service spreads I believe this could help generate deal flow for your
traders.

Let me know what you think.

Ed

HEREWITH A LETTER THAT KEN MIGHT WANT TO SEND TO CALLUM MCCARTHY
Dear Callum,
I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet
a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall
where they may.
In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an
advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus
and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member). This council meets twice a year
with Enron executives. Our next meeting is scheduled for October 31 at our
London headquarters ( we have a dinner the previous evening, at which we
review the state of political play around the world; you might find it
interesting).
One of the suggestions at the Aspen meeting was that traditional
regulation of energy markets might usefully give way to, or at least learn
some lessons from, financial regulation. Since you are one of the few
regulators who has had experience both in financial markets and in utility
regulation, we are hoping that you might be willing to share some ideas with
us on this subject. A 30-minute talk followed by what I promise will be a
very lively discussion would be perfect from our point of view.
We know how pressed you are for time, but are hoping you will favor us
with your thoughts on this interesting and difficult subject.
KEN: I don't think you can offer him a fee.","['Message-ID: <33261069.1075850036061.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Sun, 8 Jul 2001 05:35:00 -0700 (PDT)', 'From: stelzer@aol.com', 'To: klay@enron.com, skean@enron.com, rosalee.fleming@enron.com', 'Subject: London advisory council meeting', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit', 'X-From: Stelzer@aol.com', 'X-To: klay@enron.com, skean@enron.com, rosalee.fleming@enron.com', 'X-cc: ', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\Steven_Kean_Nov2001_2\\Notes Folders\\Archiving\\Untitled', 'X-Origin: KEAN-S', 'X-FileName: skean.nsf', '', 'HEREWITH A LETTER THAT KEN MIGHT WANT TO SEND TO CALLUM MCCARTHY', 'Dear Callum,', 'I much enjoyed chatting with you in Aspen: it is always a relief to meet', 'a regulator who tries to get the process right, and then lets the chips fall', 'where they may.', 'In its efforts to remain open to new ideas, Enron has established an', 'advisory council consisting of academics, business people, political gurus', 'and the like (Irwin Stelzer is a member).

From ENE to ENRNQ to EBAY

Heavy load electricity prices in the Western U.S. continued their recent
rise amid ongoing below-normal temperatures and curtailed generation.  Some
parties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role in
strengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  ""The curtailment at Diablo
Canyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  We
have below-normal temperatures everywhere, and California is having to
import lots of power from outside the state,"" said one marketer.  In fact,
there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall below
acceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergency
declaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher on
Wednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGA
weekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,
while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report
indicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in line
with most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,
1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the five-year
average.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of the
Western Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convinced
that next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In other
industry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of the
Enron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday with
lawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energy
committee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive
who wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of big
troubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shares
were trading on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter market in which
companies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enron
stock, which now trades under the symbol ""enrnq"", fell 20 cents to close at
31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of
$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,
largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exports
to California.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,
with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday and
Wednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained off
line, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330
MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecasts
were calling for below-normal temperatures to continue through the weekend,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal
temperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.

Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves falling
below WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricity
prices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in the
Golden State.  ""Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There was
some excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that the
CAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been a
while since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying in
California,"" said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 were
heard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchanged
between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with odd-lot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.
In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers on
Wednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility's
reorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practices
as ""ethical and fair"".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down on
Wednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned to
the grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in the
capital and other mid-state interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Area
and southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper-30s
to mid-40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Below-normal temperatures and increased demand from California helped to
boost day-ahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh on
Wednesday.  ""They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've even
been asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through the
evening peak,"" said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verde
saw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to
29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quickly
ratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking to
gobble up surplus supplies.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling
for below-normal temperatures to continue from January 22 through 26.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

As stronger natural gas prices, unit curtailments, and winter weather made
their presence felt, day-ahead electricity prices settled slightly higher
across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  While temperatures remained
cool, there was little change in the weather pattern since Tuesday, which
left traders perplexed about the source of Wednesday's strength,
particularly in the Midwest.  The AGA's weekly storage report listed a
withdrawal of 137 bcf, dead on with industry estimates of 135 to 140 bcf.
The AGA had little influence on late trading, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas
futures rose on Wednesday.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at
2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.

As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid were
heard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed
hands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain that
the Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that a
different Pennsylvania unit was newly off-line on Wednesday, but no one was
certain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a two
hour mid-morning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon and
averaged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected in
the upper-40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid-30s.  Cooling of
about five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM and
above-normal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.

Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,
heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest on
Wednesday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to
22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract also
traded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost a
dollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at their
Illinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down since
January 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR was
given.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-30s on Thursday,
with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly
above-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast on
Wednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slipping
towards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contract
saw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were done
between 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the
50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from
January 22 to 26.

Someparties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role instrengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  ""The curtailment at DiabloCanyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  Wehave belownormal temperatures everywhere, and California is having toimport lots of power from outside the state,"" said one marketer.  In fact,there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall belowacceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergencydeclaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher onWednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGAweekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory reportindicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in linewith most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the fiveyearaverage.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of theWestern Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convincedthat next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In otherindustry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of theEnron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday withlawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energycommittee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executivewho wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of bigtroubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shareswere trading on the Pink Sheets, an overthecounter market in whichcompanies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enronstock, which now trades under the symbol ""enrnq"", fell 20 cents to close at31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exportsto California.  Peak power at the MidColumbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts forChief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfsSaturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday andWednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained offline, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyomingbased Naughton #3 (330MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecastswere calling for belownormal temperatures to continue through the weekend,while the latest sixtoten from the NWS was calling for belownormaltemperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves fallingbelow WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricityprices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in theGolden State.  ""Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There wassome excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that theCAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been awhile since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying inCalifornia,"" said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 wereheard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchangedbetween 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with oddlot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers onWednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility'sreorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practicesas ""ethical and fair"".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down onWednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned tothe grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in thecapital and other midstate interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Areaand southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper30sto mid40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most currentsixtoten called for belownormal temperatures from January 22 to 26.Belownormal temperatures and increased demand from California helped toboost dayahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh onWednesday.  ""They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've evenbeen asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through theevening peak,"" said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verdesaw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quicklyratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking togobble up surplus supplies.

February gained 10.3 cents to close at2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid wereheard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in theMidAtlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changedhands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain thatthe Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that adifferent Pennsylvania unit was newly offline on Wednesday, but no one wascertain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a twohour midmorning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon andaveraged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected inthe upper40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid30s.  Cooling ofabout five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most currentsixtoten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM andabovenormal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest onWednesday.  Into Cinergy dayahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract alsotraded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost adollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at theirIllinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down sinceJanuary 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR wasgiven.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid30s on Thursday,with overnight lows in the mid20s.  The latest sixtoten called for mostlyabovenormal temperatures from January 22 to 26.Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast onWednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slippingtowards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contractsaw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were donebetween 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.The most current sixtoten called for abovenormal temperatures fromJanuary 22 to 26.___________________________________________________________California ISO Congestion Index in $/MWh                         Path                 Peak   Offpeakfor 17Jan02         NW1 to NP15             0.00     0.00                      NW3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                      AZ3 to SP15             0.00     0.00                      LC1 to SP15             0.00     0.00                      SP15 to NP15            0.00     0.00OTC Forward Peak Electricity Contracts in $/MWh                    MidC              PV              SP15                Bid      Ask      Bid      Ask      Bid      AskBOM            19.75    20.75    25.00    26.00    25.50    26.50February       19.50    21.00    23.50    24.50    24.75    25.75March          17.00    18.50    23.00    24.00    24.25    25.25April          17.50    19.00    24.00    25.00    NA        NAQ2 '02         17.50    19.00    26.00    27.00    25.75    26.75Q3 '02         31.00    32.50    40.00    41.00    38.50    39.50Q4 '02          NA        NA     27.00    28.00    28.00    29.00Q1 '03          NA        NA       NA       NA       NA      NACal '03        27.50    29.00    31.00    32.00    32.75    33.75Represents the most recent bid/ask spread obtainableby the Energy Market Report.Alberta Power Pool Index (C$/MWh)                    Peak(14)   Peak(16)   OffPeak    Flat     Changefor  15Jan02       46.33     45.26       17.86      36.94     0.88BPA's Offer for 01/19/02 and 01/20/02.Hours        Amount          NW delivered        COB/NOB delivered722         100MW           Market Price*          Market Price*16, 2324   100MW           Market Price*          Market Price**Market price will be determined at time of request.NYMEX Henry Hub Gas Futures in $/mmBtu                 Close        Change        Feb      2.394         0.103        Mar      2.363         0.090Natural Gas Spot Prices in $/mmBtu                  Low          HighSumas             2.13         2.18So.

Could you resume discussions with Trading Edge rather than continuing to wait

Copper Eagle Conducts Open Season for AZ Storage Facility 
Copper Eagle Gas Storage LLC., a joint event of El Paso Corp. and Pinnacle West Energy, currently is conducting a non-binding open season to assess market interest in a proposed high-deliverability natural gas storage facility to be located west of Phoenix, AZ, in Maricopa County. 
""We haven't decided whether to firmly go ahead with the project"" at this point, said Sheri Foote, a spokeswoman with Pinnacle West Energy, a subsidiary of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West Capital Corp. If Copper Eagle should receive the go-ahead, however, she noted it would be the first storage facility to be located in Arizona. She would not give a timetable as to when a final decision would be made. 
The storage facility would have a working gas storage capacity of 3.2 Bcf, with the capability of withdrawing the entire working gas volume in 10 days, and injecting the working gas volume in 20 days. The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. 
The non-binding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT. For more information about the project and the terms of the open season, go to web site www.coppereagleGS.com <http://www.coppereagleGS.com> or telephone Russ Kovin at (832) 676-5659.

The project, assuming it gets the green light, is expected to be in service by the fourth quarter of 2004. The nonbinding open season, which began last Tuesday, will run until Oct. 24 at 5 p.m. CDT.

Subject: Wholesale Deal Meetings

The following is from Mike Patrick:

Wes Colwell's Hot List Meetings have previously been held on Thursdays at 
1:30pm and attended by various parties.  This meeting has been replaced by 
the Wholesale Deal Meeting to be held at the same time and location.  The 
attendees will be comprised of each Wholesale Business Unit's CAO, 
Transaction Support lead, Tax lead and Energy Operations management.  The 
meeting will be held bi-weekly and will be adjusted as necessary.   Please 
note that the first meeting will be held tomorrow, Thursday February 22 at 
1:30pm in EB3321.

The purpose of this meeting is :

1) For the CAO/Transaction support lead to summarize the Top 3 deals for the 
quarter in each business unit, focusing on any potential issues that might 
derail the closing of the deal, and

2) For the Transaction Support team to update the group on any global 
accounting issues, and

3) To create/maintain a ""Wholesale Critical Deal Sheet"" comprised of 
Wholesale's Top Ten critical deals

The meeting is not intended to be a business unit administration meeting 
(i.e., floor space, SAP, etc.).  I believe Wes still plans to hold a 
Wholesale CAO meeting to discuss other non-deal issues.

Following are the dates of the upcoming meetings.  The meetings will be held 
from 1:30pm - 2:30pm in EB3321.

Subject: CPUC Decision Suspending Direct Access

The following points highlight legal/regulatory recommendations to the 
business team on the DA suspension issue.

All intelligence indicates that the CPUC will act on this issue at its June 
28, 2001 meeting (and there are sufficient votes for the decision).
Existing Contracts - It is our recommendation that EES should submit any and 
all DASRs to initiate DA service  to the appropriate Utility no later than 
June 29, 2001 for all customers that have existing contracts if we want to 
ensure DA service.
New Contracts - All new contracts should be signed by both EES and the 
customer no later than June 30, 2001 (July 1, 2001 is a Sunday).  DASRs for 
these contracts should be submitted to the appropriate Utility as soon as 
possible, but in no event later than July 6, 2001.  The July 6 date is our 
estimate of the last date the Utility would accept DASRs for new contracts.  
It is important to note that the CPUC is keeping the clock on contract 
execution timing.
Switching Option - Customers that are on DA service can be returned to the 
Utility per the tariff process.  Once the customer has been returned to 
Utility service after July 1, 2001, our expectation is that there will be no 
ability to have this customer receive DA service in a future timeframe.  In 
addition, returning to Utility service may incur a ""re-entry fee"".
Contract Extensions - EES should consider amending all current contracts that 
terminate after July 1, 2001 with a Evergreen Provision that provides for 
Index pricing with 30 day cancellation notice provisions.  These amendments 
should be signed prior to June 30, 2001.  It is possible that the CPUC will 
require marketers to detail the termination dates of their DA customers.  One 
additional thought - EES may consider having the customer assign any Negative 
CTC receivable to EES as compensation for the Evergreen provision (to 
overcome the CPUC language that indicates that the customer is due the 
Negative CTC credit).

We intend to set up a call for 5pm Houston time today to discuss (call-in

On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
upgrades once the delivery service begins.

Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.

Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for

We now have a computer set up so you can view the TradeSpark website.  It is 
located in a cubicle across from the C-1 conference room (on the side 
opposite of me, at EB3858D).  Since it has taken us so long to get access 
into this website, it is critical that each of you review your products 
descriptions of the website AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.  Can you each please confirm 
to me that you have completed your review and if you have any issues with the 
product descriptions please pass them on to Sheri Thomas with EnronOnline.

If for any reason you continue to have computer problems, please call Jason, 
our floor computer tech, ASAP.

Thanks for your prompt attention to this!

Tana, 

The Tradespark PC has been installed in EB3858D. I created a local account 
for all the lawyers to use to login, the userid is tradespark and the 
password is tradespark. Once they login, they will doubleclick on the 
tradespark icon on the desktop and will be at the tradespark login window. 
The userid should already be in place, but if not, it is netnrg3 and the 
password is espeed. That should get them into the tradespark system. Now, 
once Tradespark has come out with a version that is W2k compatible, we will 
install the application on each of their PC's for their convenience. Let me 
know if you need any further information. As always, I am here to help.

                                   Thanks,
       Jason

Scott, 

I just wanted to inform you that Vineyard Oil and Gas has not paid this deal for March 2001 production.  I have made several calls to speak with the lady in charge of payables.  They tell me she is never in the office, and there is no one else that is handling her duties.  I was wondering if you can speak to the trader/your contact there, so I can get this issue resolved.

Thanks,
Shielah

Skyline refers to added seasonality that NNG proposed to add to its rates.  The rate case settlement represented a compromise approach to shifting more responsibity to the peak.  So no we didn't implement Skyline as proposed and nothing is pending.  I expect that NNG will make a new proposal to refect peak cost responsibility as part of the next rate case

Here is the language which I previously requested from GE:


Winston & Strawn has asked that the following be added to the Consents
to Assignment (e.g., in the ""Successors and Assigns"" paragraph):

""WestLB is an express third-party beneficiary of this Consent.""

I have never seen the language requested before and have not signed off on 
it.  Rob Taylor and I only discussed the concept because I had never seen a 
draft of the Consent until a signed copy was delivered to me yesterday.

This language is different that what GE was told was requested before.  I
am more comfortable going back to GE with what was requested previously.

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20

ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=

would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=

will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=

Thought this might be useful for you to have as well. I highlighted the deal

Hi Pete,

Here are some comments from GE re confidentiality. Please hang on to the 
comments pending further direction.

If you are available today for the conference call, it might be helpful for 
you to listen in for a while.  If you have a conflict, don't worry about it.

Thanks,

Kay

Marty.  This is a summary of our message from this morning for you to send on 
or discuss with Keene.  I hope this is helpful.  Scott

What's important
Give solvency to the utilities by guaranteeing no banckruptcy against the 
generation assets of the utilities.  Guarantees to be recovered, if needed, 
through surcharges over 10 years.  This should give the process time for 
thoughtful solutions.  Ending the rate freeze now will give the utilities an 
undeserved windfall (3.5b alone related to nuclear assets in year 2001).
There should be thoughtful process to determine: i) how to keep deregulation 
going, ii) how existing generation assets should be used, iii) what are the 
value of existing assets, iv) when is the appropriate time for customers to 
be exposed to the market, and v) what kind of market structure would be 
appropriate going forward. 
Customers should not be dumped into the market, now or in the next year, 
while it is extremely illiquid due to many errors of the utilities.
There should not be retroactive rate making (the negative ctc should be paid 
until at least the rate freeze is ended)
All customers should be treated equally with respect to existing generation 
assets that they paid for for the past 4-30 years.
There should be a special hearing called to debate demand side prospects (ie. 
curtailment etc.)

Why?  Just b/c it wasn't what I was thinking??  You are so argumentative- 
maybe you really should consider law school.  No seriously- if that is really 
what you would rather- it is not a big deal to me.

But- when the new Harrison Ford movie comes out- we are going to see that.  
Opens late July.

Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side

have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You

Duke will be paid 9/22 for  May 2000 through July 2000.  We should have the 
August 2000 invoice by the end of next week. Megan Parker is handling this 
deal going forward and has contacted Duke to request an invoice for August.  
Megan was not receiving invoices, and since it is our policy to withhold 
payment unless we are invoiced, payment was not made on this until now.

Kris, 

Please forward this to the appropriate person.

We are buying gas from Duke at the Trevino Plant on Gulf Energy (Tejas) 
Pipeline.  This is a purchase that we obtained with the CES deal.  Duke 
(Laura Bates) has called, saying that they have not received payment in 4 or 
5 months.  The deal in Sitara is #145125.  Please look into this and let me

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

John,

The fax is coming in as we speak.  Guess it takes a while to fax it to all 
those addresses.

Would you mind call Jerry Jerry BoBerry and see what he will tell you is the 
substance of their issues, and share with him our issues.  I don't see a 
reason to kirk the whole clan for that experience.

Thanks,

Lucy,

Please fix #41 balance by deleting the $550 in the ""Rent Due"" column.  The 
other questions I had about last week's rent are:

#15  Only paid 95 of their 190 on 1/19 then paid nothing on 1/26.  What is 
going on?

#25  Looks like she was short by 35 and still owes a little on deposit

#27 Switched to weekly, but paid nothing this week.  Why?

I spoke to Jeff Smith.  I think he was surprised that we were set up with 
email and MSN Messenger.  He was not trying to insult you.  I let Jeff know 
that he should try and meet the prospective buyers when they come to see the 
property.  Occasionally, a buyer might stop buy without Jeff and you can show 
them around and let them know what a nice quiet well maintained place it is.  

Regarding the raise,  $260/week plus the apartment is all I can pay right 
now.  I increased your pay last year very quickly so you could make ends meet 
but I think your wages equate to $10/hr and that is fair.  As Gary and Wade 
continue to improve the property, I need you to try and improve the 
property's tenants and reputation.  The apartments are looking better and 
better, yet the turnover seems to be increasing.  

Remember that as a manager you need to set the example for the tenants.  It 
is hard to tell tenants that they are not supposed to have extra people move 
in that are not on the lease, when the manager has a houseful of guests.  I 
realize you have had a lot of issues with taking your son to the doctor and 
your daughter being a teenager, but you need to put in 40 hours and be 
working in the office or on the property during office unless you are running 
an errand for the property.

I am not upset that you asked for a raise, but the answer is no at this 
time.  We can look at again later in the year.

I will talk to you later or you can email or call over the weekend.

Phillip

Shan,

It's nice to hear from you. Congratulations on the new job.
FT is my favorite publication I never miss (and I read a number
of different FT publications, including FT Energy collection).

You can contact Harry Arora (X 6750)  here in London who works on
finance related E-commerce projects. He may give you some useful
comments. I shall be myself very interested in the first issue
of your new publication.

Regards

Vince

Hullo, Vince:

I hope you're very well.  As you can see, I am now working for the FT's
magazine publishing business; I have responsibility for what's currently 
termed
the Expatriate Division and I've just passed my statutory probationary period
of 3 months. Apologies for not contacting you sooner - but I guess you knew
you'd hear from me sooner or later , especially when I need help! Having 
gotten
thru probation, I am set loose upon new projects......I'm investigating 
several
ideas for new magazine product and wondered if you would be able to comment on
one of them.

Very basically, I want to develop a magazine product for the international
private investor, specifically
o HNWIs
o Owner-managers
o Results-oriented but intelligent investor with long-term investment goals 
and
a desire to be able to converse with their private bankers and/or brokers on
something approaching equal terms

The product would be delivered monthly and cater to the developing breed of
private international investor who prefers to make informed decisions - for
themselves. The product would aim to cover the major asset classes, including
the ""wilder shores"" such as Hedge Funds and Emerging Markets. I am working on 
a
portal site (imaginatively entitled FTEXPAT.COM!), nested within FT.com, which
will launch in October; International Investment will be a significant channel
on the site, and a key distribution/marketing channel for this (and future)
offering. At this very early stage I am testing out the reaction to the notion
of such a product - do you have one? Would you be able to suggest any other
contacts who might be willing/able to share their thoughts with me? I know 
it's
not bang in your sphere but I'm hoping you'll be interested enough to share
your thoughts with me.

If you can give me a few pointers, I'd be grateful. Looking forward to hearing
from you,

Sh?n

                A MESSAGE FROM DON EVANS
               CHAIRMAN, BUSH-CHENEY 2000
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Sunday, November 11, 2000



  Dear Friend,


  This is an urgent message to supporters of Governor George
  W. Bush and Secretary Dick Cheney regarding the situation
  in Florida.

  It is now clear we must raise money to fund the recount
  effort in Florida.  Governor Bush won the vote on Election
  Day, a victory confirmed by a recount.  Now, the other
  side is seeking yet a third count by hand.  There is a
  reason why ballots are counted by computer and not by hand.

  The expense of the recount effort must be funded
  immediately.  Please send a check in any amount that you
  can up to $5,000 today. These contributions, in keeping
  with Governor Bush's ""full disclosure"" policy on financial
  contributions, will be posted on the Bush-Cheney website.
  Any funds not spent will be returned on a pro rata basis.

  To contribute, please click here:
  http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf to
  download the Bush-Cheney recount fund reply form. Please
  fill out the form and mail in with your donation.

  We are setting up a site for secure online credit card
  contributions.  As soon as the Web site is available,
  we'll send out an e-mail with the link for online
  contributions.

  Remember:
  1. Checks must be personal, not corporate.
  2. Checks should be payable to Bush-Cheney Recount Fund.
  3. Download and fill out this form:
     http://www.georgewbush.com/media/pdfs/recountfund.pdf
  4. Mail or overnight check to:
        Donald L. Evans
        301 Congress Avenue
        2nd Floor/Bush-Cheney Recount Fund
        Austin, Texas 78701
  5. These funds do not count against your annual personal
     federal giving limit of $25,000.

  Thank you for your friendship and support.  If you have
  friends that can help, please forward this message to them
  immediately.   We thank you for all that you did to help
  elect Governor Bush and Secretary Cheney.  We also thank
  you in advance for your willingness to help us during this
  important time in the life of our country.


  Sincerely,

  Don Evans

Tight time frame for Mike & co. on metals deliverables.  Raises the question 
around the timing of next week's visit on metal.  Will we divert critical 
resources from these efforts.   --Sally

Please find attached the most recent update for Merchanting Metals.

In summary the planned systems changes and manual substantiation efforts are 
behind schedule. Additional resources are being allocated and the situation 
is being closely monitored ( both for quarter end signoff and on going 
operations ).

Please contact me if you require any additional information

Subject: Merchanting Metals Update #2

The intention of the efforts and actions documented in my earlier update ( 
see attached email ) was to provide  
a robust position signoff process for total metal tonnage, spread and brand 
and location
a timely substantiation of 
stock on balance sheet
forward MTM 
debtors and creditor balances
OBSF transactional values and a reconciliation of the barclays intercompany 
account

Despite the best efforts of IT, continuing problems with the AS400 
application, a better understanding of the inconsistency between stock 
reconciliation reports, and concerns over the useability of the outright 
stock screen enquiry are such that I am currently not confident of delivering 
sufficient accurate information to AA to satisfy their audit requirements - 
which at a macro level is the transparent audit trail between stock and 
forward positions to full accounting values.

Consequently I need to inform you of, and/or require your approval for, the 
following :

I will discuss with AA the following
that OBSF values within the extended trial balance may be misstated due to 
data issues ( above and beyond existing conversations with AA on model 
simplifications)
that there are reconciling differences between trader position analyses, 
AS400 on screen enquiries and the formal global position report ( these 
differences are at present not understood but would need to be provided to AA 
within the audit timetable)
an outline of the internal balance sheet review process described in my 
earlier note which must now be reprioritised and rescoped ( see MO work )
The creation of an incentive payment pool ( possibly via personal best awards 
) for key Metals staff who continue to work exceptionally unsociable hours to 
meet the above stated objectives
The signoff for additional permanent 'Enron' headcount who will 'duplicate' 
certain key position control processes ultimately replacing some existing 
Traffic staff
A reconciling difference of $15mm exists between the reported DPR and the 
final accounting p&l as generated on the AS400. We will continue to 
investigate potential misstatements in the system p&l, as a result of data or 
system valuation problems, within the month end reporting timeframe. However, 
this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and 
signoff of system p&l values with traders.
The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( 
reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and 
repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.

Middle Office work being prioritised is as follows
the stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd - with full 
reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/co-ordination
an audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing 
planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiring
full download of contract detail for later reference
reconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 th
sample tests of vanilla forward transactions
detailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to 
Barclays documentation
spreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually 
created position analysis
the circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our 
cut off and substantiation analysis
the debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 
23 rd

I will be in touch directly re the items needing approval

Regards

Mike

Subject: Merchanting Metals update

Several related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating 
risk for the Merchanting Metals business.

Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility 
(""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.
The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility 
late in the year end audit.
The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, 
arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the 
operational burden of supporting the OBSF.
The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result 
of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).
The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on 
gardening leave.
The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting 
business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.

Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain 
comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as 
to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.

The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and 
effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage 
implementation - benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting 
developers.
The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as 
to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.
Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process 
tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all 
Metals businesses.
An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 
covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand 
and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within 
the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical 
VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.
User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been 
aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of 
Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements 
for the support of OBSF.
A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control 
staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 close
A full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit 
timetable which incorporates 
A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source 
documentation within Enron
Inspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party 
inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will 
not be received on a timely basis
Substantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward 
priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report 
signed off by the traders )
Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium values
Full reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( 
thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) 
and to AS400 Barclays account
A risk based debtors review - matching to source documentation, where 
applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movements
A full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or 
external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )
A full reconciliation of intercompany accounts
A full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accounts

I intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during 
April 

If you have any questions please call me on x34703

Regards

Mike

However, this difference may need to be adjusted for following a final review and signoff of system p&l values with traders.The recall of all OBSF stock in early April and retention on balance sheet ( reduced where economically viable ) until positions are fully reconciled and repeatable daily signoff process can be instigated.Middle Office work being prioritised is as followsthe stock circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rd  with full reconciliation of returns to current system data by traffic/coordinationan audit of the stock and forward valuation report for the 30 th ( replacing planned 23 rd review due to system issues ), requiringfull download of contract detail for later referencereconciliation of stock movements between 23 rd and 30 thsample tests of vanilla forward transactionsdetailed position analysis of all OBSF contracts that must be reconciled to Barclays documentationspreadsheet recalculation of OBSF option premium utilising the above manually created position analysisthe circularisation of Barclays intercompany account and comparison to our cut off and substantiation analysisthe debtors/creditors partial circularisation initiated for close of business 23 rdI will be in touch directly re the items needing approvalRegardsMike Forwarded by Mike Jordan/LON/ECT on 29/03/2001 20:51 Mike Jordan21/03/2001 18:20To: John Sherriff/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Rick Buy/Enron@EnronXGate, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Ted Murphy/LON/ECT@ECT, Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Fernley Dyson/LON/ECT@ECT, Joe Gold/LON/ECT@ECT, Michael Farmer/EU/Enron@ENRON, Michael J Hutchinson/EU/Enron@Enron Subject: Merchanting Metals updateSeveral related issues have resulted in an increase in the level of operating risk for the Merchanting Metals business.Complexities surrounding the operation of the Off Balance Sheet Facility (""OBSF"") which commenced two weeks before the year end.The uncertainty generated by the revocation of AA's signoff for the facility late in the year end audit.The discovery of a number of 'bugs' within the AS400 Merchanting code, arising from the release of OBSF designed functionality, which compounded the operational burden of supporting the OBSF.The requirement to amend the operational process and OBSF IT code as a result of the current renegotiation of the OBSF with Barclays ( and AA ).The senior IT developer for Merchanting has resigned and been sent on gardening leave.The Corporate requirement to lower working capital usage for the Merchanting business irrespective of the above parochial business issues.Various mitigating actions have been and will be taken to provide focus, gain comfort over control levels and to provide assurance to senior management as to the accuracy of the Q1 DPR and business balance sheet.The implementation for SAP for the Merchanting business has been delayed and effectively decoupled from the higher risk ( higher benefit ) Brokerage implementation  benefit is to provide sole focus on OBSF for IT Merchanting developers.The AR/AP SAP data quality reviews for both businesses are continuing so as to provide a detailed analysis as at end Q1.Middle Office have instigated a new daily working capital report process tracking cash settlement/ funding data to working capital components for all Metals businesses.An enhanced position signoff process will be implemented prior to end Q1 covering gross tonnage, spread positions and summarised analyses for brand and locations. The necessary report functionality should be available within the AS400, however contingencies have been initiated to build tactical VBA/excel reports outside of the AS400 but using AS400 data downloads.User requests for additional AS400 functionality and reports have been aggressively prioritised and a code freeze will commence prior to the end of Q1 following the delivery of three reports determined as minimum requirements for the support of OBSF.A resubstantiation of the full Q1 DPR will be completed by the Risk control staff reconciling the full trial balances between Q1 open and Q1 closeA full internal balance sheet review will be completed within the Q1 audit timetable which incorporates A full circularisation of inventory balances, and matching to source documentation within EnronInspection of certain of the above inventory balances, by third party inspectors, where there is an expectation that circularisation replies will not be received on a timely basisSubstantive checks back to source contract documentation for the forward priced and unpriced positions report ( spot checking the key position report signed off by the traders )Full reconciliation and recalculation of OBSF option premium valuesFull reconciliation of contracts within the OBSF to Barclays documentation ( thereby substantiating existence of stock that we have option to purchase ) and to AS400 Barclays accountA risk based debtors review  matching to source documentation, where applicable, and any subsequent post quarter end cash movementsA full substantiation of creditors to internal ( contract commitments ) or external documentation ( invoices/request for payment )A full reconciliation of intercompany accountsA full substantive reconciliation of cash and funding accountsI intend to provide weekly updates on the status of the above actions during April If you have any questions please call me on x34703RegardsMike",['beth.apollo@enron.com'],1

Subject: Summary of the MOU

The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California=
=20
Edison Memorandum of Understanding:

? Commitment to Provide Power =01) SCE will keep its current generation pla=
nts=20
and other generation assets and commit them to provide power on a regulated=
=20
cost-of-service basis for 10 years.
? Dedication of Power =01) Edison International will commit the entire outp=
ut of=20
Sunrise (one of Edison International=01,s non-regulated generating faciliti=
es)=20
to the State on a fixed price basis for 10 years. Phase I of Sunrise is to =
be=20
brought online by August 15, 2001. If not brought online by August 15, 2001=
,=20
Edison International shall be assessed a $2 million penalty.
? Transmission Sale =01) SCE will sell to the State its transmission assets=
 for=20
approximately $2.76 billion (2.3 times the net book value of the assets),=
=20
subject to certain adjustments. Of the $2.76 billion, the $1.5 billion gain=
=20
on sale, will be used to reduce SCE=01,s net undercollected amount as of Ja=
nuary=20
31, 2001. In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa=
in=20
liabilities associated with the transmission assets.
? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw=
o=20
years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,=
 SCE=20
shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets. If the hydro asse=
ts=20
are not worth $1.5 billion, then SCE will also sell the state after Decembe=
r=20
31, 2010 enough below-market-price-power to make up the shortfall.
? Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen=
ts to=20
the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr=
ic=20
related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related=20
lands.  Some of the land may be deeded in fee.
? Contribution by Edison International =01) Edison International will refun=
d to=20
SCE not less than $400 million.  This money will consist of a refund of=20
approximately $293 million in estimated 2000 quarterly tax payments plus=20
approximately $197 million in federal loss carryback tax savings.
? Investment =01) Edison International and SCE will invest not less than $3=
=20
billion over the next 5 years in capital improvements for SCE.
? Litigation =01) SCE shall dismiss certain claims, including its takings a=
nd=20
filed rate doctrine cases.
? CPUC Regulation =01) CPUC shall continue to regulate SCE using historical=
=20
principles of ratemaking.
? Payment for Portion of QF Drop-off =01) SCE shall pay an amount that=20
represents that portion of the net short from January 18, 2001 to April 1,=
=20
2001 that is attributable to QF=01,s not selling to SCE (due to SCE=01,s fa=
ilure to=20
pay the QF=01,s).  SCE will securitize this amount.
? Securitization =01) SCE shall securitize its full net undercollected amou=
nt=20
(approx. $3.5 billion).  The securitization shall occur in two tranches (i.=
e.=20
two different nonbypassable dedicated rate components).

? The first tranche will occur after the passage of legislation and the=20
signing of the definitive agreements and will cover the net undercollected=
=20
amount, less the gain on sale, plus interest on certain obligations in the=
=20
net undercollected amount.
? The second tranche would be triggered if the transmission sale does not=
=20
occur within two years.  Accordingly, the second tranche would not show up =
in=20
rates for two years, if at all.

? Buying the Net Short =01) The State will be required to buy the net short=
=20
through December 31, 2002.  After 2002 SCE will be responsible for covering=
=20
the net short.
? Investment Recovery =01) SCE shall have an authorized rate of return that=
 will=20
not drop below its current rte (11.6%) during the 10 year cost of service=
=20
ratemaking period.
? Next Steps (Definitive Agreements and CPUC Action):

? Definitive Agreements =01) Once the MOU is signed, the next stage is to=
=20
negotiate definitive agreements which contain the specific terms of the=20
transmission sale, as well as the specific terms of the various other relat=
ed=20
agreements (e.g., the O&M Agreement, Transmission Services Agreement and th=
e=20
Facilities Services Agreement).
? CPUC Action =01) Prior to entering into the definitive agreements, the CP=
UC=20
must undertake certain actions (which include: establishing mechanisms for=
=20
preapproval of procurement costs and URG costs, deferring SCE=01,s general =
rate=20
case until 2003, granting SCE some relief from direct access credits and=20
clarifying the first priority condition in the holding company act).","['Message-ID: <18800674.1075848252346.JavaMail.evans@thyme>', 'Date: Tue, 10 Apr 2001 00:36:00 -0700 (PDT)', 'From: steven.kean@enron.com', 'To: jeff.skilling@enron.com, kenneth.lay@enron.com, rick.buy@enron.com, richard.causey@enron.com, mark.koenig@enron.com', 'Subject: Summary of the MOU', 'Mime-Version: 1.0', 'Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ANSI_X3.4-1968', 'Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable', 'X-From: Steven J Kean', 'X-To: Jeff Skilling, Kenneth Lay, Rick Buy, Richard Causey, Mark Koenig', 'X-cc: ', 'X-bcc: ', 'X-Folder: \\Steven_Kean_June2001_5\\Notes Folders\\Sent', 'X-Origin: KEAN-S', 'X-FileName: skean.nsf', '', '---------------------- Forwarded by Steven J Kean/NA/Enron on 04/10/2001=20', '07:35 AM ---------------------------', 'From: Jeff Dasovich on 04/09/2001 07:00 PM', 'Sent by: Jeff Dasovich', 'To: Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Angela Schwarz/HOU/EES@EES, Beverly=20', 'Aden/HOU/EES@EES, Bill Votaw/HOU/EES@EES, Brenda Barreda/HOU/EES@EES, Carol=', '=20', 'Moffett/HOU/EES@EES, Cathy Corbin/HOU/EES@EES, Chris H Foster/HOU/ECT@ECT,=', '=20', 'Christina Liscano/HOU/EES@EES, Craig H Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Dan=20', 'Leff/HOU/EES@EES, Debora Whitehead/HOU/EES@EES, Dennis Benevides/HOU/EES@EE=', 'S,=20', 'Don Black/HOU/EES@EES, Dorothy Youngblood/HOU/ECT@ECT, Douglas=20', 'Huth/HOU/EES@EES, Edward Sacks/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Eric Melvin/HOU/EES@EES,=', '=20', 'Erika Dupre/HOU/EES@EES, Evan Hughes/HOU/EES@EES, Fran Deltoro/HOU/EES@EES,=', '=20', 'Gayle W Muench/HOU/EES@EES, Ginger Dernehl/NA/Enron@ENRON, Gordon=20', 'Savage/HOU/EES@EES, Harold G Buchanan/HOU/EES@EES, Harry=20', 'Kingerski/NA/Enron@ENRON, Iris Waser/HOU/EES@EES, James D=20', 'Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, James W Lewis/HOU/EES@EES, James Wright/Western=20', 'Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Jeff Messina/HOU/EES@EES, Jeremy=20', 'Blachman/HOU/EES@EES, Jess Hewitt/HOU/EES@EES, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON=', ',=20', 'Karen Denne/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Kathy Bass/HOU/EES@EES, Kathy=20', 'Dodgen/HOU/EES@EES, Ken Gustafson/HOU/EES@EES, Kevin Hughes/HOU/EES@EES,=20', 'Leasa Lopez/HOU/EES@EES, Leticia Botello/HOU/EES@EES, Mark S=20', 'Muller/HOU/EES@EES, Marsha Suggs/HOU/EES@EES, Marty Sunde/HOU/EES@EES,=20', 'Meredith M Eggleston/HOU/EES@EES, Michael Etringer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Michael=20', 'Mann/HOU/EES@EES, Michelle D Cisneros/HOU/ECT@ECT, mpalmer@enron.com, Neil=', '=20', 'Bresnan/HOU/EES@EES, Neil Hong/HOU/EES@EES, Paul Kaufman/PDX/ECT@ECT, Paula=', '=20', 'Warren/HOU/EES@EES, Richard L Zdunkewicz/HOU/EES@EES, Richard=20', 'Leibert/HOU/EES@EES, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rita=20', 'Hennessy/NA/Enron@ENRON, Roger Yang/SFO/EES@EES, Rosalinda=20', 'Tijerina/HOU/EES@EES, Sandra McCubbin/NA/Enron@ENRON, Sarah=20', 'Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Gahn/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Stoness/HOU/EES@EES=', ',=20', 'Sharon Dick/HOU/EES@EES, skean@enron.com, Tanya Leslie/HOU/EES@EES, Tasha=', '=20', 'Lair/HOU/EES@EES, Ted Murphy/HOU/ECT@ECT, Terri Greenlee/NA/Enron@ENRON, Ti=', 'm=20', 'Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tony Spruiell/HOU/EES@EES, Vicki Sharp/HOU/EES@EES,=20', 'Vladimir Gorny/HOU/ECT@ECT, Wanda Curry/HOU/EES@EES, William S=20', 'Bradford/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kathryn Corbally/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jubran=20', 'Whalan/HOU/EES@EES, triley@enron.com, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert=', ' C=20', 'Williams/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Greg Wolfe/HOU/ECT@ECT, James=', '=20', 'Wright/Western Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Dirk vanUlden/Western=', '=20', 'Region/The Bentley Company@Exchange, Steve Walker/SFO/EES@EES, Jennifer=20', 'Rudolph/HOU/EES@EES, Martin Wenzel/SFO/HOU/EES@EES, Douglas=20', 'Condon/SFO/EES@EES, wgang@enron.com, Scott Govenar <sgovenar@govadv.com>,=', '=20', 'Hedy Govenar <hgovenar@govadv.com> @ ENRON, jklauber@llgm.com, Mike D=20', 'Smith/HOU/EES@EES, John Neslage/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Janel=', '=20', 'Guerrero/Corp/Enron@Enron, Eric Letke/DUB/EES@EES, Richard B=20', 'Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, gfergus@brobeck.com, Michael Tribolet/ENRON@enronXgate=', ',=20', 'Robert Frank/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT,=20', 'gfergus@brobeck.com, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Mercy Gil/Enron@EnronXGat=', 'e,=20', 'Jennifer Thome/NA/Enron@Enron, David Leboe/HOU/ECT@ECT', 'cc: =20', '', 'Subject: Summary of the MOU', '', 'The following is an outline of the basic terms of the Southern California=', '=20', 'Edison Memorandum of Understanding:', '', '?

In connection with the purchase, the State will also assume certa=in=20liabilities associated with the transmission assets.? Backup Transaction =01) If the transmission sale does not occur within tw=o=20years for reasons beyond the parties=01, control, then if the State elects,= SCE=20shall sell to the State SCE=01,s hydro generation assets.

Conservation Property =01) SCE shall grant perpetual conservation easemen=ts to=20the State covering approximately 260,000 acres of its Big Creek hydroelectr=ic=20related lands and 825 acres of its Eastern Sierra hydroelectric related=20lands.

NFL Reports, Player Updates 	
  <http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N1549.sportsline.com/B44933.5;sz=1x1;ord=1?>
Latest NFL Player News

Jay Fiedler <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12363&>, QB MIA - Tori Updated 12/29/01
Fiedler has been added to Miami's injury report with a sore throwing elbow. He is listed as probable for Sunday's game against Atlanta, and is expected to start. If you're desperate for a quarterback, Fiedler's matchup vs. the Falcons is a good one. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
McNair was excused from practice on Friday due to a family illness. He is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Cleveland, but he's expected to start. 

Larry Foster <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188491&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Foster (thigh) is expected to play in Sunday's game against Chicago. However, he is far too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy season. 

Bert Emanuel <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1186&>, WR DET - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Emanuel (knee) is expected to play on Sunday against Chicago. However, he's too risky to start at this point in the Fantasy Football season. 

Muhsin Muhammad <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1203&>, WR CAR - Martin Updated 12/29/01
Muhammad (turf toe) will not play this week, and may miss the rest of the season. Isaac Byrd will likely start in his place again. 

Seahawks <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=27&>, DT SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
CB Shawn Springs, who was suspended for the past four games, will not start on Sunday against San Diego. He may play a reserve role, however, but his playing time will likely be limited. 

Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Bouman will miss Sunday's game against Green Bay due to a thumb injury. Spergon Wynn will start in his place. 

Spergon Wynn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187690&>, QB MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
Wynn will start Sunday's game against the Green Bay Packers in place of the injured Todd Bouman. Wynn, who played in most of last week's loss to Jacksonville, is far too inexperienced to start this deep into the Fantasy season. 

Drew Bledsoe <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1041&>, QB NE - Free Agent Updated 12/29/01
According to published reports, the Chicago Bears are interested in acquiring Bledsoe. With Tom Brady seemingly entrenched as New England's quarterback, it seems that Bledsoe has become expendable to the Patriots. The move would certainly improve the Bears' passing game, but no deals would likely be made until sometime in the spring. 

Martin Gramatica <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133297&>, K TB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Gramatica has still not been ruled out for Saturday's game, although the Buccaneers have signed veteran kicker Doug Brien as insurance. Even if Gramatica can play, he will be a very risky Fantasy starter. 

Warrick Dunn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1171&>, RB TB - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Dunn's status is day to day with a toe injury. He is expected to play this week, but Mile Alstott has been the most productive back on the team in recent weeks. 

Michael Westbrook <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1310&>, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Westbrook's status is day to day with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

MarTay Jenkins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=133322&>, WR ARI - Martin Updated 12/28/01
Jenkins may miss his second consecutive game with an ankle injury this week. Arnold Jackson would replace him as Arizona's third receiver.

Brian Finneran <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=12366&>, WR ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Finneran is listed as probable with a knee injury. He is expected to play this week. 

Tyrone Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1499&>, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Davis has been elevated to the No. 2 tight end slot over rookie David Martin. He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. 

Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1612&>, WR MIA - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play. But his hamstring injury may limit his productivity. 

Steve McNair <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1069&>, QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
McNair was limited in practice on Thursday. He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy. 

Jimmy Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1236&>, WR JAC - Frank Updated 12/28/01
Smith (flu) has missed practice time this week. He is still expected to play. 

Joe Horn <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1511&>, WR NO - Matty Updated 12/28/01
Horn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice on Thursday. He is expected to start this week. 

Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187642&>, TE CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/28/01
Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. 

Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=192266&>, RB BAL - Tori Updated 12/28/01
Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.

He will see a considerable amount of playing time now that he is healthy, because Green Bay employs many double tight end sets in the red zone. Oronde Gadsden <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1612&>, WR MIA  Matty Updated 12/28/01Gadsden has been practicing this week and may be able to play.

He is still expected to play this week, but he is a risky Fantasy starter because he will be less than 100 percent healthy.

He is expected to start this week. Aaron Shea <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=187642&>, TE CLE  Free Agent Updated 12/28/01Shea (shoulder) has been placed on injured reserve. O.J. Santiago will continue to be Cleveland's No. 1 tight end while he is out. Jason Brookins <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=192266&>, RB BAL  Tori Updated 12/28/01Brookins has returned to practice and is listed as probable. But he still may not see any game action until Week 17.Emmitt Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1094&>, RB DAL  Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01Micahel Wiley may miss this week's game with a hip injury. Smith is expected to appear on third downs this week as well as assuming his normal workload. James Thrash <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1859&>, WR PHI  Frank Updated 12/28/01Thrash (ankle) returned to practice on Thursday. he is expected to play this week. Wesley Walls <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1321&>, TE CAR  Free Agent Updated 12/28/01Walls missed practice on Thursday with a knee injury. He may be a gametime decision this week. Maurice Smith <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=188183&>, RB ATL  Frank Updated 12/28/01A bangedup Smith Toe/knee) will continue to start for the Falcons.

Stephen Davis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1440&>, RB WAS  Bass/Hull Updated 12/28/01Davis (knee) has returned to practice. He is expected to start this week. Todd Bouman <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1871&>, QB MIN  Free Agent Updated 12/28/01Bouman took a few snaps Thursday but didn't appear to meet coach Dennis Green's ""full strength"" criteria for starting against Green Bay. Spergon Wynn is likely to start Sunday, though coaches didn't discuss the issue after Thursday's practice. Bouman didn't participate in the team's morning walkthrough, when players work on plays without fully suiting up. And during the portion of the regular practice that reporters were allowed to watch, Wynn took more snaps than Bouman. A trainer said Wynn continued to take more snaps later in the closed portion of practice. Jerome Bettis <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1152&>, RB PIT  Giggles Updated 12/28/01Bettis, sidelined by a groin injury, returned to the practice field Thursday for the first time in a month. ""Still questionable,"" coach Bill Cowher said. ""He did more today. We'll see how he feels (Friday) and go from there. We'll take it day to day."" Doug Brien <http://football299.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=bige01&owner=14696.2&random=136&key=1393&>, K TB  Free Agent Updated 12/28/01Brien signed a oneyear contract Thursday night with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who will use him against Baltimore if Martin Gramatica can't kick this week. Gramatica strained his right hamstring during a 4821 victory over the Saints last week. Coach Tony Dungy hasn't ruled him out for Saturday night's game against Baltimore, however the club wanted to have a backup plan in case the Pro Bowl kicker isn't ready.

I can do it either way but would much rather just make it the simple average 
of prices, 5 per week.

Subject: SMUD deal Asian options

John(s),

How will the Asian options we purchased from the gas desk settle with respect 
to weekends... will the average of every day's gas daily settle mean the 
average of only the days on which Gas Daily is published?  or will it triple 
count each Friday's or Monday's price to account for the weekend (with a 
similar calculation on weekends).  I assume it is the former, not the 
latter.  Is this correct?  Are you indifferent if we want to switch to the 
latter?  Intuitively, it would seem to me that at this point, it wouldn't 
matter (because Friday or Monday prices are just as likely to be above the 
average as below the average), but you're wearing the risk, not us - so let 
me know.

Frankly, we don't have a preference as a desk, except that we need the 
settlement to be consistent with the deal we are entering into with SMUD.  
SMUD has questioned our calculation and I need to know how much I need to 
argue for one or the other.

Regards,
Gary

Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella 
in Public Relations.  The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark 
Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Americas be responsive when 
we are asked for information from our business units.  Please pass along to 
Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your group that will be 
responsible for providing updates for the weekly newsletter.  Kathie has 
assured me that the person providing the information is not required to do 
the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she will then prepare in 
paragraph form.  Michelle will send a reminder message to the contact person 
when the updates are needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

Attached is a revised draft of the letter from Ken Lay to employees about the healthcare benefits plan.  Specifically, this letter points out that Enron has elected not to increase medical costs for employees this year, but emphasizes that employees should plan for increased costs next year.  The letter will be part of an Open Enrollment package that employees will receive at their homes.

Please forward comments on the letter to me or Mikie Rath.

Is there any language that tells us that the surcharges are not applicable to 
future DA customers?  Obviously it should not since they would be paying for 
generation twice but the other surcharge did apply.  Please let me know ASAP.

Subject: California PUC Orders

Orders the CPUC voted out yesterday:


1) March 27 decision on California Procurement Adjustment:

 - CPUC01-#93704-v1-D0103081_A0011038_et_al__.doc
This tells the utilities to start paying DWR an amount per kwh equal to the 
utilities' average cost of generation for all power provided by DWR, and asks 
for additional comment on how the California Procurement Adjustment is 
calculated.

2)  March 27 decision on rate increase is not yet available but is largely 
unchanged from proposed decision:

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/cyberdocs/tcquickstart.asp?DOC_ID=93630&docType=LEGAL_P
ROCEED
This is the order that allows the rate increase to take effect.

3)  March 27 decision on rate design is not yet available but also is not 
likely to change from proposed decision:

http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/cyberdocs/tcquickstart.asp?DOC_ID=93589&docType=LEGAL_P
ROCEED
This is the order that says the rate increase will not be a uniform across 
the board increase, but rather will achieve conservation and equity goals.

Regarding the rate increase of 3 cents, it is effective yesterday but the 
Commission did not describe exactly how it will be implemented.  For example, 
they could 
a) allow a 3 cent surcharge until the rate design phase is complete, and then 
switch over to the new rate design around, say, May 15; or
b) allow a 3 cent surcharge to be billed and then retroactively adjust the 
billing based on the new rate design, once it is known.

LME Base Metals:Aluminum Ends Officials Dn On Fresh Sales

07/06/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- London Metal Exchange three-month aluminum ended 
officials lower Friday from Thursday's late kerb, on heavy fresh speculator 
selling in Asian trade and an unexpected stock build, dealers said. 
(LME three-month prices in dollars a metric ton at officials, with the 
previous late kerb close in brackets. Comex copper at 1324 GMT in cents a 
pound, with the previous close in brackets.)
Copper 1,562.50 (1,560.00) Tin 4,537.50 (4,535.00) 
Aluminum 1,449.50 (1,451.50) Zinc 886.25 (884.50) 
Nickel 5,975.00 (5,962.50) Lead 459.50 (450.50) 
Comex Sep Copper 70.25 (70.85) 
The Asian selloff forced aluminum down to a one-year low at $1,434/ton, and 
after some early forward buying interest in the pre-market in London, the 
market took a further blow as LME stock movements were released. 
Aluminum stocks rose 1,450 tons Friday, bringing total stocks to 626,550 
tons. 
""It (the stock increase) was fairly unexpected, but it exposes the slackening 
demand that has characterized this market for the last six months,"" said one 
LME dealer. 
The move kept aluminum prices depressed for much of the morning, before more 
forward and bank buying emerged in the first two rings to pull prices off the 
lows for officials. 
Aluminum's early falls pulled the already nervous copper market to a two-year 
low at $1,552/ton, and although the latter's stock rise was much more 
considerable, it had been expected, dealers said. 
Copper stocks in LME warehouses have risen by over 50,000 tons in the last 
two weeks, and a number of dealers are still insistent that another 
30,000-40,000 tons will be seen in the coming two weeks. 
Unconfirmed reports have said major trade house Enron is behind the stock 
build, in an effort to reduce the market's nearby supply tightness and 
alleviate the large short positions they are thought to have built up on the 
July-for-a-week spread. 
However, the stock builds are only having a limited effect in easing the 
tightness. 
""Everyone knows what they (Enron) are up to, and won't lend until they're 
really hurting,"" one LME floor dealer said. 
Spreads were also a focus of the tin market, where prices slumped to an 
eight-year low at $4,490/ton, after the cash-to-three-month spread reverted 
to a $25/ton contango Friday morning from a $60/ton backwardation at the 
beginning of the week. 
The move was caused by heavy lending of the nearby spreads and rolling 
forward to September, a tin dealer said. 
""I think we've seen the last of the tightness for a couple of months,"" he 
added.

AsiaWeek

Convincing foreign investors that his country is a good place to do business 
is a tough sell. But Delhi's finance minister insists that despite a few 
high-profile setbacks his country offers the world's best returns 
Indian finance minister Yashwant Sinha has had a roller-coaster year. In 
February, he delighted foreign investors with a reformist, pro-business 
budget. But days later, confidence was rocked by a stock market crash and 
insider trading scandal.
Then New Delhi's first major privatization, of the BALCO aluminum plant, 
sparked a crippling two-month strike by workers. Worse, India's biggest and 
once most trumpeted foreign investment, Enron Corp's $3-billion Dabhol power 
project, remains at a standstill following claims the Maharashtra state 
government defaulted on payments. A U.S.-led $1.6-billion power project near 
Madras is stalled over financing. 
Recently, during a road show to Hong Kong and Singapore, Sinha spoke with 
Executive Editor Richard Hornik, Managing Editor Zoher F. Abdoolcarim and 
Senior Editor Cesar Bacani. Extracts from their conversation: 
Can India really compete for investment? 
We have completely opened up the Indian market. I know that China and other 
countries have been receiving large foreign direct investments, but let's not 
forget that they started much earlier on the reform path. The problem is one 
of perception. We have the challenging task of explaining the new India to 
the world. 
Don't you also have the task of explaining it to the Indian people? Isn't 
there a resentment of foreign companies left over from the colonial era? 
Every government has pursued the same reform path, including welcoming 
foreign direct investment. There has [also] been a very marked change from 
what you referred to as the colonial past. The increasing realization is that 
it is not Western multinationals that are causing problems. It is competition 
from other developing countries. 
There seems to be disquiet among investors, though, about high-profile cases 
such as Enron and BALC0. 
BALCO had nothing to do with foreign investment. It was a 100% government 
company, and we decided to sell 51% along with management control. There was 
some resistance, but fortunately that has been resolved. In the case of Enron
, I have clearly sent out a message to both the Maharashtra government and 
[Enron] that they had to sit down in the spirit of constructive cooperation 
and find a solution. Let's not [interpret] a commercial dispute involving one 
company as being a major disincentive for foreign investment. 
What are you doing to increase governance in the financial world? 
I have told Parliament three things: That we shall adopt international best 
practices so that the scope of mischief is reduced further; that we must 
strengthen the market regulator; and that we want to corporatize the stock 
exchanges, which are run by the brokers, so there can be no conflict of 
interest. 
In India, can what is manufactured by foreign-owned firms be sold locally? 
Absolutely. And because of its sheer size, India's middle class of 250-300 
million consumers is almost like a middle-sized [developed] country. In terms 
of purchasing power parity, India is considered to be the world's third 
largest economy. Another advantage for investors] is that we have a judicial 
system that does justice to Indians and foreigners alike. 
But it's slow - very slow. 
When you say slow, there are courts of appeal from primary courts to the High 
Court to the Supreme Court. You can't do away with this. You can't compare it 
with autocratic regimes, where justice can be swift but at times misguided. 
How is the privatization program faring? 
In the case of Air India, we decided we'd retain 40%, 10% would go to 
employees, another 10% would go to the market and 40% would be made available 
to strategic buyers. Only 26% would go to foreign partners. Similarly we have 
taken a decision to disinvest [telco] VSNL. We will privatize the domestic 
airline, Indian Airlines, the largest automobile manufacturer, Maruti, and 
hotels owned by the Tourism Development Corp. 
What are your main frustrations? 
Foreign investors have all kinds of perceptions that India is not worth doing 
business with, [but] studies by independent consultants A.T. Kearney and the 
Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry show foreign direct investors have 
made more profits in India than anywhere else in the world and most are 
bullish about the future. Now this is something that is not known.

India: Dabhol delay: RCF turns to BG

Asia Intelligence Wire 

BANGALORE, July 5. FACED with delays in gas availability from Enron's Dabhol 
regassification plant, the public sector Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers 
Ltd (RCF), has turned to British Gas (BG) for supply of liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) to meet its feed stock requirements. Speaking to reporters here today, 
the RCF Chairman and Managing Director, Mr D.K. Verma, said that RCF's 
requirement of LNG was about 1.5 million tonnes per annum. 
As per the agreement with Enron, the LNG supply was expected to have begun 
from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra. Enron's requirement for power 
generation was only about 2.5 million tonnes and the remaining was expected 
to be sold to third parties which included RCF.
However, he said, these supplies were faced with uncertainty in view of the 
stand-off between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron. 
Asked if this would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron, he 
said: ""We still need LNG. When supply from Dabhol is available we will pick 
it up."" 
In addition to this supply, BG was also expected to supply another 1.7 
million from Gujarat to the Trombay plant of RCF. This requirement was in 
view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant. The 
capacity of the urea plant is to be raised to 2.3 million tonnes from the 
current level of 1.5 million tonnes. This expansion is expected to cost at 
least Rs 1,400 crore, of which Rs 800 crore would be funded from RCF's cash 
reserves. 
The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI. ""We are a zero-debt 
company now and can afford to have a little debt on our balance sheet,"" he 
said. The company, he said, was also preparing to expand its DAP (di-ammonium 
phosphate) capacity in Rajasthan at a cost of Rs 300 crore. This four-lakh 
tonne per annum plant was being set up with 25 per cent equity support each 
from Hindustan Zinc Ltd and Rajasthan Mines and Minerals Corporation Ltd. The 
remaining 50 per cent would be entirely held by RCF itself, he added. 
Mr Verma indicated that a final decision on the expansion of the urea plant 
would be taken by the company's board only after the interim fertiliser 
policy was announced by the Centre. This policy is expected to provide for a 
pricing policy and prepare the industry for complete dismantling of the 
retention pricing mechanism. 
He said that the industry was also looking forward to supplies of LNG from 
Iran. Supply of gas through the pipeline route via Pakistan would be more 
cost-effective than the submarine pipeline proposed.

`Reduce government debt by Rs 2000 crore
ET Interview / Shalini Singh

The Economic Times 
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) 

FOR an organisation that has done its best to boost sentiment by repeatedly 
announcing that it expects the economy to grow by 6.5 to 7 per cent this 
year, the Confederation of Indian Industries, finds the current official 
projections of 5.2 per cent way down at the lower end of their own forecast. 
I believe our projections were realistic considering that on the economic 
front all the macro-fundamentals are in place. The policies are in place.
It is just that the implementation of these policies is not happening. And 
that is the only reason for a lower growth rate than was envisaged by 
industry. 
No. There is no way that can happen. On the other hand, with some hard 
decisions, we could still move closer to a growth of 6.5 per cent. 
The most radical would be a dramatic reduction in government debt by Rs 
20,000 crore right away. We need to examine what we need to do to achieve 
this level of reduction and the whole country needs to cooperate in the 
effort. 
The whole nation needs to rally around the FM if he makes these moves. We 
need to move ahead on disinvestment, on reduction in expenditure. 
What we are additionally prescribing is that issues and policies which have 
been committed should be implemented. Implementation is going to be the key 
to success. 
The CII is preparing to submit, over the next fortnight, a list of 20 
projects in housing, power, roads, railways and civil aviation to the 
government to be monitored on a weekly basis to stimulate growth. 
Growth can also be stimulated by increased government spending on creating 
world class capitals for the three new states Uttaranchal, Jharkhand and 
Chhatisgarh. 
With an expenditure of just Rs 10-15,000 crore, the government can stimulate 
demand in cement, power, roads and infrastructure. The funds are there. It is 
just that there is no thought or planning in this direction yet. 
The third thing that we are prescribing is that interest rates must come 
down. I disagree with the RBIs stand on interest rates. Like in the US, we 
too must respond quickly and proactively to the slowdown. 
Fourthly, we have an overvalued exchange rate and we believe it is time we 
moved to a realistic exchange rate. We are just about to see the first 
effects of an overvalued rupee on the growth rate of exports and we need to 
arrest this declining rate of export growth. 
On the contrary, there is recognition and respect for the government that 
despite a global slowdown, India is still the second fastest growing economy 
after China. 
Any disappointment that is voiced is actually in the spirit of moving to 
better performance rather than a critique of the establishment. 
I truly believe we are today at the threshold of a unique opportunity. 
Different countries the US, EU, Malaysia and so on want to engage in trade 
with India in a manner that nobody has looked at before. 
President Bush and the Bush administration want to engage in a substantial 
trade relationship with India which is based on mutually beneficial long-term 
relationships. It offers India a unique window. 
There is huge respect for Mr Vajpayee, Mr Jaswant Singh and Mr Yashwant 
Sinha. The world is recognising Indias potential. 
Enron is an issue in the minds of the Americans that is stalling investment 
commitment, despite this respect, and this must be addressed quickly if we 
are to maximise on our overseas business dialogue.

RCF plans to ink supply pact with British Gas

Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd (RCF) is planning to sign an agreement 
with British Gas for supply of gas to meet its fleet stock needs. 
RCF chairman and managing director D K Verma told newspersons that the 
company's requirement of LNG was about 1.5 million tonne per annum. As per 
its existing agreement with Enron, LNG supply should have already began from 
Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra.
Enron's requirement for power generation was only about 2./5 million tonne 
and the remaining was to be sold to third parties including RCF. The RCF, CMD 
said that these supplies now faced an uncertain future, because of the 
stand-off between MSEB and Enron. 
Asked if it would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron, he said 
""We still need LNG. If supply is available from Dabhol we will pick it up,"" 
he said in reaction to a question on whether it would lead to a termination 
of RCF's agreement with Enron. 
In addition to this supply, British Gas is also expected to supply another 
1.7 million tonne to the Trombay plant of RCF. This requirement was in view 
of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant of RCF. 
""The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised from 2.3 million tonne from 
the production level of 1.5 million tonne."" This expansion is expected to 
cost at least Rs 1,400 crore, of which Rs 800 crore would be funded from 
RCF's cash reserves, he said. 
The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI. The company he said 
was also preparing to expand DAP in Rajasthan for Rs 300 crore. 
This 4 lakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with 25 per cent equity 
support each from Hindustan Zinc and the Rajasthan Mines and Minerals 
Corporation. The remaining 50 per cent would be held by RCF itself. 
Verma also said that the final decision of the expansion of the urea plant 
would be taken by the board of the company only after the interim fertiliser 
policy announcement to be announced by the Centre. 
The policy is expected to provide an interim measure of fertiliser pricing 
and prepare the industry for complete dismantling of the retention pricing 
mechanism.

Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political 
support
Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews

North Sports Final ; N

(Copyright 2001 by the Chicago Tribune) 

Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western 
states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite 
opposition to price caps in the Bush administration. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation 
measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when 
blackouts are possible.
The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent 
emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came 
with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western 
states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped 
wholesale prices in the region. 
The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion 
cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 
billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 
billion in 2001. 
With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a 
question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be 
solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. 
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the 
actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to 
whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power 
generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it 
estimates independent power generators overcharged California's troubled 
utilities. 
The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC 
for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up 
prices in California. 
""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall 
conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity 
supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. 
Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, 
Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came 
out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for 
California. 
""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're 
proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position 
supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation. 
What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain 
powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power 
authority to build state-owned plants.

The US' Enron Corporation is in talks with Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company 
(Adgas), Qatar's Ras Laffan Liquefied Natural Gas Company (RasGas) and Oman 
LNG Company to finalise short-term spot agreements for liquefied natural gas 
(LNG). 
""The target markets are the East Coast of the US and Europe,"" says an 
industry official. ""Deliveries are presently being made to the US under an 
agreement with Oman LNG.""
Enron signed a master agreement with Oman LNG in mid-2000 for the export of 
six 87,000-cubic-metre cargoes. The US energy firm has already taken two 
cargoes under the deal (MEED 22:6:01). ""Enron is looking to increase the 
off-take from Oman,"" the official says. The US energy firm has been in talks 
with RasGas since 1997 for a short-term spot sales and purchase agreement. 
Enron will use an 87,000-cubic-metre LNG carrier, Hoegh Galleon, that its 
owns and operates, for shipments of LNG after it finalises the deals with the 
three Gulf LNG producers. 
Two new LNG carriers, each of 138,000 cubic metres in capacity, will enter 
into service by the summer of 2002 and will trade from the Gulf to the US and 
Europe. By the end of 2001, Enron will take delivery of Laxmi, at present 
under construction in South Korea. The vessel is owned jointly by Japan's 
Mitsui OSK Line, Shipping Corporation of India and Enron. In July 2002, the 
second new carrier, Excalibur, will join Enron's LNG fleet. 
Gulf LNG producers are also monitoring a plan by the US' CMS Energy to double 
the capacity of its LNG terminal at Lake Charles in Louisiana. ""The demand 
for LNG in the southern American market is projected to increase, as CMS 
plans to build two new LNG terminals on the east and west coasts of Mexico,"" 
says the industry official. 
CMS has signed agreements for 10 cargoes of Qatari LNG. Three cargoes were 
scheduled for delivery from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company and the remaining 
seven from RasGas. CMS has been a regular purchaser of spot LNG cargoes from 
Qatar over the past three years (MEED 19:5:00).

Dabhol Project Vexes Foreign Firms --- If Enron's Dispute in India Isn't 
Resolved, Other Investments Could Suffer --- Regulators and Courts Throw in a 
New Twist
By Daniel Pearl
Staff Reporter

BOMBAY -- Once touted as a beacon for attracting foreign investment to India, 
Enron Corp.'s $3 billion Dabhol Power Co. project has turned into a nuisance 
for some foreign companies doing business in the country. 
Behind the scenes, some of them are now maneuvering to help resolve a dispute 
between Dabhol and the Indian state of Maharashtra that is at the core of the 
project's problems.
The largest-ever foreign investment in India, Dabhol is mired in conflict. 
Maharashtra, Dabhol's only customer, has stopped purchasing power from the 
740-megawatt project, saying its rates are too high. Work has stopped on a 
nearly completed second phase of the project slated to generate 1,444 
megawatts. Enron, which controls 65% of the project, has tried unsuccessfully 
to scale back its stake and may be looking to exit entirely. 
In an effort to get the electricity project back on track, some of the 
project's foreign lenders -- including ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp. and 
Credit Suisse First Boston -- sent representatives to a recent meeting here 
with Maharashtra's electricity board. Dabhol's difficulties are making 
lenders wary about funding other power projects in the country, and could 
make states bolder about seeking new contract terms. 
That has left other power companies increasingly nervous about Dabhol. Some 
have signaled they could be interested in taking over the project if its 
contract problems can be settled. Dabhol participants still aren't sure if 
the interest is sincere or is an attempt by the other companies to prevent 
collateral damage to their own projects. India's Reliance Industries Ltd., 
which, in partnership with Southern Co. of Atlanta, is hoping to build a big 
plant in eastern India, doesn't deny media speculation that it is interested 
in Dabhol. Nor does Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp., whose generating 
company has had disputes with India's Orissa state. 
Prakash Daryani, managing director for Houston-based El Paso Corp.'s Indian 
power unit, says that if the Dabhol contract isn't resolved in a way that 
makes both the utility and Maharashtra happy, ""it will have an adverse 
impact"" on other investments, and ""El Paso will not be an exception."" He 
denies reports that El Paso, which helped build a 340-megawatt plant in 
Southern India, has expressed interest in buying Dabhol, but adds: ""We are 
keeping our eyes and ears open."" 
Some companies may be doing more than that. Patrick Sonti, a New Delhi-based 
energy consultant, said he had helped draft a plan outlining a way out of the 
Dabhol impasse, with price concessions on both sides and financial separation 
of Enron's liquefied-natural gas terminal from the power plant. Mr. Sonti 
says he studied Dabhol for a client whose name he can't disclose. Mr. Sonti 
also chairs an American Chamber of Commerce committee on energy, and he 
acknowledges discussing his Dabhol plan with some of the panel's members. He 
says the Chamber wouldn't intervene unless asked by Enron. 
Last time the project ran into trouble with the state, Enron executives saved 
it through an intensive lobbying campaign, aided by American officials. Next 
week, the company's chairman, Kenneth Lay, is expected to fly to India, 
though Enron won't comment on whom he intends to visit. 
Even though Enron and Maharashtra officials have met regularly, their dispute 
has fallen into a slow-motion stalemate, with Enron saying it hasn't agreed 
to renegotiate the contract and the state insisting it has already rescinded 
the contract. Despite warnings that construction delays will increase the 
project's cost by up to $400 million, Vinay Bansal, chairman of the 
electricity board, said Monday that getting the project's second phase 
running is ""not a priority for us,"" since the state can't afford the power. 
The Dabhol contract requires the state to pay for most of the plant's 
generating capacity regardless of how much power it consumes. Maharashtra's 
consumption has been far below projections. 
Mr. Bansal wants India's central government to help buy excess power from 
Dabhol, but ""they keep saying no."" Other states would be willing to buy power 
if the rates could be lowered to 2.50 rupees (5.3 cents) a unit, but that's 
still well below Dabhol officials' most optimistic projection. 
Meanwhile, India's regulators and courts are throwing in new twists. The 
Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, set up as an independent body 
to regulate electricity rates, is seeking jurisdiction over the Dabhol 
dispute, even though the commission was created after the Dabhol contract was 
signed. Enron wants an arbitration panel to decide instead. A Bombay judge 
issued a ruling last week that is likely to send the jurisdiction battle to 
India's Supreme Court. 
If Enron loses that battle, it is likely to lose more time. ""We'll make the 
process totally transparent,"" the chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity 
Regulatory Commission, P. Subramanyam, promised in an interview earlier this 
year. 
But if Dabhol construction doesn't resume by summer's end, Enron's suppliers 
of liquefied natural gas are likely to get nervous. Dabhol has 20-year 
contracts requiring it to buy liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman 
starting next year. As for the lenders, Indian banks have more to lose than 
foreign banks if Dabhol, starved of revenue, continues to miss payments. That 
is because much of the foreign debt is guaranteed by the Indian banks, led by 
state-controlled Industrial Development Bank of India. For the project's 
second phase, foreign debt totals nearly $1.1 billion, and domestic debt 
about $330 million. Lenders haven't yet agreed to inject more funds to allow 
construction to resume. 
""I don't think there is any division among lenders at the moment as to what 
should be done,"" says an international lender involved in the talks. ""But 
this is not an easy workout, having so many parties involved in so many parts 
of the world.""


Enron May Spin Off Enron Wind Unit This Year, Reuters Reports
2001-07-06 07:18 (New York)


     Copenhagen, July 6 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. may spin off
its wind-power unit Enron Wind as early as this year, Reuters
reported, citing comments made by Enron Wind managing director
Andreas Reuter on Wednesday.
     The unit most likely would be taken over by an investor and
then shares sold in an initial public stock offering, Reuters
reported, citing comments Reuter made on the sidelines of a
European Wind Energy Conference and exhibition in Copenhagen.
     Enron Wind is concentrating its expansion plans on France,
Ireland and the Netherlands, Reuter said.
     Enron Wind currently produces power in Germany and Spain and
would consider moving to the U.K. as well if that market ``starts
moving,'' Reuters reported, citing Reuter.

Davis Appeals Order to Release Calif. Power Contracts (Update2)

Davis Appeals Order to Release Calif. Power Contracts (Update2)

     (Adds details on filing of governor's appeal.)

     San Diego, July 5 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis has appealed a state judge's order to release records of how
much the state spent purchasing power on the spot market.
     San Diego Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn ruled last week
that the governor had to produce spot market invoices, purchase
orders and confirmation sheets for power supply contracts signed
from January 1 through June 27.
     Quinn directed Davis to produce the documents by July 16, but
she temporarily suspended her order today to allow a state appeals
court to consider the governor's appeal, which was filed Tuesday.
     Several media organizations and Republican state legislators
sued in March under California's public records law to obtain the
contracts, arguing that the state used billions in taxpayer money
to buy power.
     ``There's an obvious and manifest public interest in
disclosure of these contracts,'' said Alonzo Wickers, a lawyer
representing the media companies, at a hearing last week.
     Davis countered that disclosure would hurt the state's
bargaining position with generators and force it to pay higher
prices.
     Media companies had also sought disclosure of 38 uncensored
long-term contracts to buy $43 billion in electricity. State
Controller Kathleen Connell released those contracts on Monday.
     Connell, a fellow Democrat, has criticized the governor for
keeping the contracts secret. She also released terms of
consulting contracts the state made with investment advisers and
energy traders.

                          Power Purchases

     The state has spent about $7.4 billion buying electricity for
three investor-owned utilities. The state's Department of Water
Resources now buys about one-third of the power used by the
state's two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric
and Edison International's Southern California Edison. Pacific Gas
declared bankruptcy in April.
     Legislators and consumer groups have criticized Davis, saying
the state is locking itself into expensive long-term contracts
that would force it to pay higher rates for electricity in future
years.
     Those seeking access to the long-term and spot-market
contract information include Copley Press Inc., Tribune Co.'s Los
Angeles Times and Bloomberg LP's Bloomberg News. State Assemblyman
Tony Strickland, joined by 10 fellow Republican Assembly members,
filed a similar suit in March.

58 percent since the initial offering. AES, based in Arlington,
Virginia, fell 93 cents to $42.07. Detroit-based DTE rose 18 cents
to $46.68.

', ""Maharashtra, Dabhol's only customer, has stopped purchasing power from the "", '740-megawatt project, saying its rates are too high. Work has stopped on a ', 'nearly completed second phase of the project slated to generate 1,444 ', 'megawatts. Enron, which controls 65% of the project, has tried unsuccessfully ', 'to scale back its stake and may be looking to exit entirely. ', 'In an effort to get the electricity project back on track, some of the ', ""project's foreign lenders -- including ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp. and "", 'Credit Suisse First Boston -- sent representatives to a recent meeting here ', ""with Maharashtra's electricity board. Dabhol's difficulties are making "", 'lenders wary about funding other power projects in the country, and could ', 'make states bolder about seeking new contract terms. ', 'That has left other power companies increasingly nervous about Dabhol. Some ', 'have signaled they could be interested in taking over the project if its ', ""contract problems can be settled. Dabhol participants still aren't sure if "", 'the interest is sincere or is an attempt by the other companies to prevent ', ""collateral damage to their own projects. India's Reliance Industries Ltd., "", 'which, in partnership with Southern Co. of Atlanta, is hoping to build a big ', ""plant in eastern India, doesn't deny media speculation that it is interested "", 'in Dabhol. Nor does Arlington, Virginia-based AES Corp., whose generating ', ""company has had disputes with India's Orissa state. "", ""Prakash Daryani, managing director for Houston-based El Paso Corp.'s Indian "", ""power unit, says that if the Dabhol contract isn't resolved in a way that "", 'makes both the utility and Maharashtra happy, ""it will have an adverse ', 'impact"" on other investments, and ""El Paso will not be an exception."" He ', 'denies reports that El Paso, which helped build a 340-megawatt plant in ', 'Southern India, has expressed interest in buying Dabhol, but adds: ""We are ', 'keeping our eyes and ears open."" ', 'Some companies may be doing more than that. Patrick Sonti, a New Delhi-based ', 'energy consultant, said he had helped draft a plan outlining a way out of the ', 'Dabhol impasse, with price concessions on both sides and financial separation ', ""of Enron's liquefied-natural gas terminal from the power plant. Mr. Sonti "", ""says he studied Dabhol for a client whose name he can't disclose. Mr. Sonti "", 'also chairs an American Chamber of Commerce committee on energy, and he ', ""acknowledges discussing his Dabhol plan with some of the panel's members. He "", ""says the Chamber wouldn't intervene unless asked by Enron. "", 'Last time the project ran into trouble with the state, Enron executives saved ', 'it through an intensive lobbying campaign, aided by American officials. Next ', ""week, the company's chairman, Kenneth Lay, is expected to fly to India, "", ""though Enron won't comment on whom he intends to visit. "", 'Even though Enron and Maharashtra officials have met regularly, their dispute ', ""has fallen into a slow-motion stalemate, with Enron saying it hasn't agreed "", 'to renegotiate the contract and the state insisting it has already rescinded ', 'the contract. Despite warnings that construction delays will increase the ', ""project's cost by up to $400 million, Vinay Bansal, chairman of the "", ""electricity board, said Monday that getting the project's second phase "", 'running is ""not a priority for us,"" since the state can\'t afford the power. ', ""The Dabhol contract requires the state to pay for most of the plant's "", ""generating capacity regardless of how much power it consumes. Maharashtra's "", 'consumption has been far below projections. ', ""Mr. Bansal wants India's central government to help buy excess power from "", 'Dabhol, but ""they keep saying no."" Other states would be willing to buy power ', ""if the rates could be lowered to 2.50 rupees (5.3 cents) a unit, but that's "", ""still well below Dabhol officials' most optimistic projection. "", ""Meanwhile, India's regulators and courts are throwing in new twists. The "", 'Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, set up as an independent body ', 'to regulate electricity rates, is seeking jurisdiction over the Dabhol ', 'dispute, even though the commission was created after the Dabhol contract was ', 'signed. Enron wants an arbitration panel to decide instead. A Bombay judge ', 'issued a ruling last week that is likely to send the jurisdiction battle to ', ""India's Supreme Court. "", 'If Enron loses that battle, it is likely to lose more time. ""We\'ll make the ', 'process totally transparent,"" the chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity ', 'Regulatory Commission, P.

Dabhol has 20-year ', 'contracts requiring it to buy liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman ', 'starting next year. As for the lenders, Indian banks have more to lose than ', 'foreign banks if Dabhol, starved of revenue, continues to miss payments. That ', 'is because much of the foreign debt is guaranteed by the Indian banks, led by ', ""state-controlled Industrial Development Bank of India. For the project's "", 'second phase, foreign debt totals nearly $1.1 billion, and domestic debt ', ""about $330 million.

Comex copper at 1324 GMT in cents a pound, with the previous close in brackets.)Copper 1,562.50 (1,560.00) Tin 4,537.50 (4,535.00) Aluminum 1,449.50 (1,451.50) Zinc 886.25 (884.50) Nickel 5,975.00 (5,962.50) Lead 459.50 (450.50) Comex Sep Copper 70.25 (70.85) The Asian selloff forced aluminum down to a oneyear low at $1,434/ton, and after some early forward buying interest in the premarket in London, the market took a further blow as LME stock movements were released. Aluminum stocks rose 1,450 tons Friday, bringing total stocks to 626,550 tons. ""It (the stock increase) was fairly unexpected, but it exposes the slackening demand that has characterized this market for the last six months,"" said one LME dealer. The move kept aluminum prices depressed for much of the morning, before more forward and bank buying emerged in the first two rings to pull prices off the lows for officials. Aluminum's early falls pulled the already nervous copper market to a twoyear low at $1,552/ton, and although the latter's stock rise was much more considerable, it had been expected, dealers said. Copper stocks in LME warehouses have risen by over 50,000 tons in the last two weeks, and a number of dealers are still insistent that another 30,00040,000 tons will be seen in the coming two weeks. Unconfirmed reports have said major trade house Enron is behind the stock build, in an effort to reduce the market's nearby supply tightness and alleviate the large short positions they are thought to have built up on the Julyforaweek spread. However, the stock builds are only having a limited effect in easing the tightness. ""Everyone knows what they (Enron) are up to, and won't lend until they're really hurting,"" one LME floor dealer said. Spreads were also a focus of the tin market, where prices slumped to an eightyear low at $4,490/ton, after the cashtothreemonth spread reverted to a $25/ton contango Friday morning from a $60/ton backwardation at the beginning of the week. The move was caused by heavy lending of the nearby spreads and rolling forward to September, a tin dealer said. ""I think we've seen the last of the tightness for a couple of months,"" he added.

But Delhi's finance minister insists that despite a few highprofile setbacks his country offers the world's best returns Indian finance minister Yashwant Sinha has had a rollercoaster year. In February, he delighted foreign investors with a reformist, probusiness budget. But days later, confidence was rocked by a stock market crash and insider trading scandal.Then New Delhi's first major privatization, of the BALCO aluminum plant, sparked a crippling twomonth strike by workers. Worse, India's biggest and once most trumpeted foreign investment, Enron Corp's $3billion Dabhol power project, remains at a standstill following claims the Maharashtra state government defaulted on payments. A U.S.led $1.6billion power project near Madras is stalled over financing. Recently, during a road show to Hong Kong and Singapore, Sinha spoke with Executive Editor Richard Hornik, Managing Editor Zoher F. Abdoolcarim and Senior Editor Cesar Bacani. Extracts from their conversation: Can India really compete for investment? We have completely opened up the Indian market. I know that China and other countries have been receiving large foreign direct investments, but let's not forget that they started much earlier on the reform path. The problem is one of perception. We have the challenging task of explaining the new India to the world. Don't you also have the task of explaining it to the Indian people? Isn't there a resentment of foreign companies left over from the colonial era? Every government has pursued the same reform path, including welcoming foreign direct investment. There has [also] been a very marked change from what you referred to as the colonial past. The increasing realization is that it is not Western multinationals that are causing problems. It is competition from other developing countries. There seems to be disquiet among investors, though, about highprofile cases such as Enron and BALC0. BALCO had nothing to do with foreign investment. It was a 100% government company, and we decided to sell 51% along with management control. There was some resistance, but fortunately that has been resolved. In the case of Enron, I have clearly sent out a message to both the Maharashtra government and [Enron] that they had to sit down in the spirit of constructive cooperation and find a solution. Let's not [interpret] a commercial dispute involving one company as being a major disincentive for foreign investment. What are you doing to increase governance in the financial world? I have told Parliament three things: That we shall adopt international best practices so that the scope of mischief is reduced further; that we must strengthen the market regulator; and that we want to corporatize the stock exchanges, which are run by the brokers, so there can be no conflict of interest. In India, can what is manufactured by foreignowned firms be sold locally? Absolutely. And because of its sheer size, India's middle class of 250300 million consumers is almost like a middlesized [developed] country. In terms of purchasing power parity, India is considered to be the world's third largest economy. Another advantage for investors] is that we have a judicial system that does justice to Indians and foreigners alike. But it's slow  very slow. When you say slow, there are courts of appeal from primary courts to the High Court to the Supreme Court. You can't do away with this. You can't compare it with autocratic regimes, where justice can be swift but at times misguided. How is the privatization program faring? In the case of Air India, we decided we'd retain 40%, 10% would go to employees, another 10% would go to the market and 40% would be made available to strategic buyers. Only 26% would go to foreign partners. Similarly we have taken a decision to disinvest [telco] VSNL. We will privatize the domestic airline, Indian Airlines, the largest automobile manufacturer, Maruti, and hotels owned by the Tourism Development Corp. What are your main frustrations? Foreign investors have all kinds of perceptions that India is not worth doing business with, [but] studies by independent consultants A.T. Kearney and the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry show foreign direct investors have made more profits in India than anywhere else in the world and most are bullish about the future. Now this is something that is not known.India: Dabhol delay: RCF turns to BG07/06/2001Business Line (The Hindu) Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM)  Asia Intelligence Wire BANGALORE, July 5. FACED with delays in gas availability from Enron's Dabhol regassification plant, the public sector Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd (RCF), has turned to British Gas (BG) for supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to meet its feed stock requirements. Speaking to reporters here today, the RCF Chairman and Managing Director, Mr D.K. Verma, said that RCF's requirement of LNG was about 1.5 million tonnes per annum. As per the agreement with Enron, the LNG supply was expected to have begun from Dabhol to its Thal plant in Maharashtra. Enron's requirement for power generation was only about 2.5 million tonnes and the remaining was expected to be sold to third parties which included RCF.However, he said, these supplies were faced with uncertainty in view of the standoff between the Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Enron. Asked if this would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron, he said: ""We still need LNG. When supply from Dabhol is available we will pick it up."" In addition to this supply, BG was also expected to supply another 1.7 million from Gujarat to the Trombay plant of RCF. This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant. The capacity of the urea plant is to be raised to 2.3 million tonnes from the current level of 1.5 million tonnes. This expansion is expected to cost at least Rs 1,400 crore, of which Rs 800 crore would be funded from RCF's cash reserves. The debt component is expected to be raised from ICICI. ""We are a zerodebt company now and can afford to have a little debt on our balance sheet,"" he said. The company, he said, was also preparing to expand its DAP (diammonium phosphate) capacity in Rajasthan at a cost of Rs 300 crore. This fourlakh tonne per annum plant was being set up with 25 per cent equity support each from Hindustan Zinc Ltd and Rajasthan Mines and Minerals Corporation Ltd. The remaining 50 per cent would be entirely held by RCF itself, he added. Mr Verma indicated that a final decision on the expansion of the urea plant would be taken by the company's board only after the interim fertiliser policy was announced by the Centre. This policy is expected to provide for a pricing policy and prepare the industry for complete dismantling of the retention pricing mechanism. He said that the industry was also looking forward to supplies of LNG from Iran. Supply of gas through the pipeline route via Pakistan would be more costeffective than the submarine pipeline proposed.  Our Bureau`Reduce government debt by Rs 2000 croreET Interview / Shalini Singh07/06/2001The Economic Times Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM) FOR an organisation that has done its best to boost sentiment by repeatedly announcing that it expects the economy to grow by 6.5 to 7 per cent this year, the Confederation of Indian Industries, finds the current official projections of 5.2 per cent way down at the lower end of their own forecast. I believe our projections were realistic considering that on the economic front all the macrofundamentals are in place. The policies are in place.It is just that the implementation of these policies is not happening. And that is the only reason for a lower growth rate than was envisaged by industry. No. There is no way that can happen. On the other hand, with some hard decisions, we could still move closer to a growth of 6.5 per cent. The most radical would be a dramatic reduction in government debt by Rs 20,000 crore right away. We need to examine what we need to do to achieve this level of reduction and the whole country needs to cooperate in the effort. The whole nation needs to rally around the FM if he makes these moves. We need to move ahead on disinvestment, on reduction in expenditure. What we are additionally prescribing is that issues and policies which have been committed should be implemented. Implementation is going to be the key to success. The CII is preparing to submit, over the next fortnight, a list of 20 projects in housing, power, roads, railways and civil aviation to the government to be monitored on a weekly basis to stimulate growth. Growth can also be stimulated by increased government spending on creating world class capitals for the three new states Uttaranchal, Jharkhand and Chhatisgarh. With an expenditure of just Rs 1015,000 crore, the government can stimulate demand in cement, power, roads and infrastructure. The funds are there. It is just that there is no thought or planning in this direction yet. The third thing that we are prescribing is that interest rates must come down. I disagree with the RBIs stand on interest rates. Like in the US, we too must respond quickly and proactively to the slowdown. Fourthly, we have an overvalued exchange rate and we believe it is time we moved to a realistic exchange rate. We are just about to see the first effects of an overvalued rupee on the growth rate of exports and we need to arrest this declining rate of export growth. On the contrary, there is recognition and respect for the government that despite a global slowdown, India is still the second fastest growing economy after China. Any disappointment that is voiced is actually in the spirit of moving to better performance rather than a critique of the establishment. I truly believe we are today at the threshold of a unique opportunity. Different countries the US, EU, Malaysia and so on want to engage in trade with India in a manner that nobody has looked at before. President Bush and the Bush administration want to engage in a substantial trade relationship with India which is based on mutually beneficial longterm relationships. It offers India a unique window. There is huge respect for Mr Vajpayee, Mr Jaswant Singh and Mr Yashwant Sinha. The world is recognising Indias potential. Enron is an issue in the minds of the Americans that is stalling investment commitment, despite this respect, and this must be addressed quickly if we are to maximise on our overseas business dialogue.RCF plans to ink supply pact with British GasOur Bureau Bangalore07/06/2001Business Standard 4Copyright (c) Business Standard Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers Ltd (RCF) is planning to sign an agreement with British Gas for supply of gas to meet its fleet stock needs.

Asked if it would lead to a termination of the agreement with Enron, he said ""We still need LNG. If supply is available from Dabhol we will pick it up,"" he said in reaction to a question on whether it would lead to a termination of RCF's agreement with Enron. In addition to this supply, British Gas is also expected to supply another 1.7 million tonne to the Trombay plant of RCF. This requirement was in view of the capacity expansion that has been proposed for the urea plant of RCF.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when blackouts are possible.The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped wholesale prices in the region. The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27 billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70 billion in 2001. With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences. California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it estimates independent power generators overcharged California's troubled utilities. The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up prices in California. ""FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity supply to influence prices,"" the GAO found. Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy, Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came out in April in favor of some sort of short term price relief for California. ""The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're proposing,"" Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position supporting some limited, shortterm price mitigation. What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power authority to build stateowned plants.Business/Financial Desk; Section CCOMPANY NEWSENERGY PROVIDER IS PLANNING TWO ACQUISITIONSReuters07/06/2001The New York Times Page 4, Column 1c. 2001 New York Times Company The New Power Company, a national energy provider partly owned by Enron, said yesterday that it planned to make two acquisitions that would increase its customer base by about 20 percent and increase its presence in Pennsylvania and Ohio.

""The target markets are the East Coast of the US and Europe,"" says an industry official. ""Deliveries are presently being made to the US under an agreement with Oman LNG.""Enron signed a master agreement with Oman LNG in mid2000 for the export of six 87,000cubicmetre cargoes. The US energy firm has already taken two cargoes under the deal (MEED 22:6:01). ""Enron is looking to increase the offtake from Oman,"" the official says. The US energy firm has been in talks with RasGas since 1997 for a shortterm spot sales and purchase agreement. Enron will use an 87,000cubicmetre LNG carrier, Hoegh Galleon, that its owns and operates, for shipments of LNG after it finalises the deals with the three Gulf LNG producers. Two new LNG carriers, each of 138,000 cubic metres in capacity, will enter into service by the summer of 2002 and will trade from the Gulf to the US and Europe. By the end of 2001, Enron will take delivery of Laxmi, at present under construction in South Korea. The vessel is owned jointly by Japan's Mitsui OSK Line, Shipping Corporation of India and Enron. In July 2002, the second new carrier, Excalibur, will join Enron's LNG fleet. Gulf LNG producers are also monitoring a plan by the US' CMS Energy to double the capacity of its LNG terminal at Lake Charles in Louisiana. ""The demand for LNG in the southern American market is projected to increase, as CMS plans to build two new LNG terminals on the east and west coasts of Mexico,"" says the industry official. CMS has signed agreements for 10 cargoes of Qatari LNG. Three cargoes were scheduled for delivery from Qatar Liquefied Gas Company and the remaining seven from RasGas. CMS has been a regular purchaser of spot LNG cargoes from Qatar over the past three years (MEED 19:5:00).News Highlights: Chang Hwa Bk 1H Pretax Pft NT$1.46B07/06/2001Dow Jones International News (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY  Once touted as a beacon for attracting foreign investment to India, Enron Corp.'s $3 billion Dabhol Power Co. project has turned into a nuisance for some foreign companies doing business in the country. Behind the scenes, some of them are now maneuvering to help resolve a dispute between Dabhol and the Indian state of Maharashtra that is at the core of the project's problems.The largestever foreign investment in India, Dabhol is mired in conflict. Maharashtra, Dabhol's only customer, has stopped purchasing power from the 740megawatt project, saying its rates are too high. Work has stopped on a nearly completed second phase of the project slated to generate 1,444 megawatts. Enron, which controls 65% of the project, has tried unsuccessfully to scale back its stake and may be looking to exit entirely. In an effort to get the electricity project back on track, some of the project's foreign lenders  including ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp. and Credit Suisse First Boston  sent representatives to a recent meeting here with Maharashtra's electricity board. Dabhol's difficulties are making lenders wary about funding other power projects in the country, and could make states bolder about seeking new contract terms. That has left other power companies increasingly nervous about Dabhol. Some have signaled they could be interested in taking over the project if its contract problems can be settled. Dabhol participants still aren't sure if the interest is sincere or is an attempt by the other companies to prevent collateral damage to their own projects. India's Reliance Industries Ltd., which, in partnership with Southern Co. of Atlanta, is hoping to build a big plant in eastern India, doesn't deny media speculation that it is interested in Dabhol. Nor does Arlington, Virginiabased AES Corp., whose generating company has had disputes with India's Orissa state. Prakash Daryani, managing director for Houstonbased El Paso Corp.'s Indian power unit, says that if the Dabhol contract isn't resolved in a way that makes both the utility and Maharashtra happy, ""it will have an adverse impact"" on other investments, and ""El Paso will not be an exception."" He denies reports that El Paso, which helped build a 340megawatt plant in Southern India, has expressed interest in buying Dabhol, but adds: ""We are keeping our eyes and ears open."" Some companies may be doing more than that. Patrick Sonti, a New Delhibased energy consultant, said he had helped draft a plan outlining a way out of the Dabhol impasse, with price concessions on both sides and financial separation of Enron's liquefiednatural gas terminal from the power plant. Mr. Sonti says he studied Dabhol for a client whose name he can't disclose. Mr. Sonti also chairs an American Chamber of Commerce committee on energy, and he acknowledges discussing his Dabhol plan with some of the panel's members. He says the Chamber wouldn't intervene unless asked by Enron. Last time the project ran into trouble with the state, Enron executives saved it through an intensive lobbying campaign, aided by American officials. Next week, the company's chairman, Kenneth Lay, is expected to fly to India, though Enron won't comment on whom he intends to visit. Even though Enron and Maharashtra officials have met regularly, their dispute has fallen into a slowmotion stalemate, with Enron saying it hasn't agreed to renegotiate the contract and the state insisting it has already rescinded the contract. Despite warnings that construction delays will increase the project's cost by up to $400 million, Vinay Bansal, chairman of the electricity board, said Monday that getting the project's second phase running is ""not a priority for us,"" since the state can't afford the power. The Dabhol contract requires the state to pay for most of the plant's generating capacity regardless of how much power it consumes. Maharashtra's consumption has been far below projections. Mr. Bansal wants India's central government to help buy excess power from Dabhol, but ""they keep saying no."" Other states would be willing to buy power if the rates could be lowered to 2.50 rupees (5.3 cents) a unit, but that's still well below Dabhol officials' most optimistic projection. Meanwhile, India's regulators and courts are throwing in new twists. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, set up as an independent body to regulate electricity rates, is seeking jurisdiction over the Dabhol dispute, even though the commission was created after the Dabhol contract was signed. Enron wants an arbitration panel to decide instead. A Bombay judge issued a ruling last week that is likely to send the jurisdiction battle to India's Supreme Court. If Enron loses that battle, it is likely to lose more time. ""We'll make the process totally transparent,"" the chairman of the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission, P. Subramanyam, promised in an interview earlier this year. But if Dabhol construction doesn't resume by summer's end, Enron's suppliers of liquefied natural gas are likely to get nervous. Dabhol has 20year contracts requiring it to buy liquefied natural gas from Abu Dhabi and Oman starting next year. As for the lenders, Indian banks have more to lose than foreign banks if Dabhol, starved of revenue, continues to miss payments. That is because much of the foreign debt is guaranteed by the Indian banks, led by statecontrolled Industrial Development Bank of India. For the project's second phase, foreign debt totals nearly $1.1 billion, and domestic debt about $330 million. Lenders haven't yet agreed to inject more funds to allow construction to resume. ""I don't think there is any division among lenders at the moment as to what should be done,"" says an international lender involved in the talks. ""But this is not an easy workout, having so many parties involved in so many parts of the world.""Enron May Spin Off Enron Wind Unit This Year, Reuters Reports20010706 07:18 (New York)     Copenhagen, July 6 (Bloomberg)  Enron Corp. may spin offits windpower unit Enron Wind as early as this year, Reutersreported, citing comments made by Enron Wind managing directorAndreas Reuter on Wednesday.

Power Contracts (Update2)20010705 17:31 (New York)Davis Appeals Order to Release Calif. Power Contracts (Update2)     (Adds details on filing of governor's appeal.)     San Diego, July 5 (Bloomberg)  California Governor GrayDavis has appealed a state judge's order to release records of howmuch the state spent purchasing power on the spot market.     San Diego Superior Court Judge Linda Quinn ruled last weekthat the governor had to produce spot market invoices, purchaseorders and confirmation sheets for power supply contracts signedfrom January 1 through June 27.     Quinn directed Davis to produce the documents by July 16, butshe temporarily suspended her order today to allow a state appealscourt to consider the governor's appeal, which was filed Tuesday.     Several media organizations and Republican state legislatorssued in March under California's public records law to obtain thecontracts, arguing that the state used billions in taxpayer moneyto buy power.     ``There's an obvious and manifest public interest indisclosure of these contracts,'' said Alonzo Wickers, a lawyerrepresenting the media companies, at a hearing last week.     Davis countered that disclosure would hurt the state'sbargaining position with generators and force it to pay higherprices.     Media companies had also sought disclosure of 38 uncensoredlongterm contracts to buy $43 billion in electricity. StateController Kathleen Connell released those contracts on Monday.     Connell, a fellow Democrat, has criticized the governor forkeeping the contracts secret. She also released terms ofconsulting contracts the state made with investment advisers andenergy traders.                          Power Purchases     The state has spent about $7.4 billion buying electricity forthree investorowned utilities. The state's Department of WaterResources now buys about onethird of the power used by thestate's two largest utilities, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electricand Edison International's Southern California Edison. Pacific Gasdeclared bankruptcy in April.     Legislators and consumer groups have criticized Davis, sayingthe state is locking itself into expensive longterm contractsthat would force it to pay higher rates for electricity in futureyears.     Those seeking access to the longterm and spotmarketcontract information include Copley Press Inc., Tribune Co.'s LosAngeles Times and Bloomberg LP's Bloomberg News.

As you know, Enron=01,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way=
. =20
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize th=
e=20
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the=
=20
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of=20
August 3rd less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge. =20
Enron=01,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corpora=
te=20
match). ENA=01,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressiv=
e=20
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, =
we=20
can easily surpass these goals.=20

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I=01,d like to have 100=
%=20
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important=20
among our executives.  We define ""participation"" as an employee who has=20
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the=
=20
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a=20
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this yea=
r=20
than last year.  Enron has 39 members of this Society, only 5 of which are=
=20
from ENA.  I would like to see this number increase significantly and if yo=
u=20
are able, I would like you to consider stepping up to this level.  Given th=
e=20
fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and=
=20
bonus program, I encourage each of you to at least become a member of the=
=20
""Make a Difference"" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of your annual=20
salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your pledge this=20
year, regardless of your level of giving last year.
=20
With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I=01,ll need the=
=20
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across=
=20
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision=
=20
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our=20
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your=20
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our=20
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and=20
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

Spotlight Report 
  Exchange products seeing slow trading
  GAVIN SOUTER

  03/20/2000 
  Business Insurance 
  Page 3

  reserved. 

  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have
  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.

  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since
  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a
  significant volume of trades.

  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away
  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains
  abundant and relatively cheap.

  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major
  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will
  remain limited, observers say.

  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the
  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he
  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one
  contract against another.

  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to
  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has
  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,
  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in
  New York.

  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not
  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way
  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified
  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently
  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that
  hedge, he said.

  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then
  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.
  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane
  explained.

  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to
  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he
  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop
  indexes, Mr. Lane said. ""For the insurance buyer, such exchange
  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but
  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a
  good surrogate,"" he said.

  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of
  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.

  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of
  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior
  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance
  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.

  ""The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not
  looking for other ways of doing business,"" he said.

  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar
  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success
  since they were introduced in the 1970s. ""There is a belief that
  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to
  predict when,"" Mr. Mooney said.

  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves
  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not
  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.

  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities
  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,
  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little
  activity.

  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative
  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board
  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.

  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft
  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge
  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker
  at the CBOT who trades in options.

  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT
  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in
  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were
  traded, Mr. Purty said.

  ""I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they
  really take off,"" he said.

  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to
  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance
  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative
  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.

  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has
  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in
  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,
  chief operating officer.

  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for
  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks
  and to build balanced portfolios.

  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it
  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX
  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney
  said.

  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of
  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.
  Sweeney said.

  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a ""cash for cover""
  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange
  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability
  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where
  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry
  loss over an agreed threshold.

  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible
  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX
  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them
  form groups whose members do business only with one another.

  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,
  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,
  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,
  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their
  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.

  ""We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied
  with what we have achieved so far,"" Mr. Sweeney said.

  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents
  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their
  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was
  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last
  year.

  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field
  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather
  derivatives .

  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry
  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.

  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against
  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in
  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a
  resultant fall in revenues.

  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,
  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,
  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering
  contracts based on cold weather.

  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers
  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more
  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for

All rights  reserved.   Exchangebased insurance products developed in recent years have  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since  the mid1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a  significant volume of trades.  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains  abundant and relatively cheap.  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchangebased products will  remain limited, observers say.  Also stifling the growth of the exchangebased contracts is the  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one  contract against another.  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in  New York.  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that  hedge, he said.  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane  explained.  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop  indexes, Mr. Lane said. ""For the insurance buyer, such exchange  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a  good surrogate,"" he said.  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for  overthecounter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of  exchangebased insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.  ""The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not  looking for other ways of doing business,"" he said.  At least in concept, the exchangebased deals are generally similar  to the mortgagebacked securities that have been a huge success  since they were introduced in the 1970s. ""There is a belief that  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to  predict when,"" Mr. Mooney said.  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little  activity.  The oldest of the insurancerelated, exchangebased derivative  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker  at the CBOT who trades in options.  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were  traded, Mr. Purty said.  ""I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they  really take off,"" he said.  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in  mid1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,  chief operating officer.  CATEX initially planned to be a computerbased facility for  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks  and to build balanced portfolios.  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney  said.  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.  Sweeney said.  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a ""cash for cover""  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry  loss over an agreed threshold.  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them  form groups whose members do business only with one another.  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.  ""We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied  with what we have achieved so far,"" Mr. Sweeney said.  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last  year.  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field  of insurancerelated derivatives when it began offering weather  derivatives .  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against  weatherrelated losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a  resultant fall in revenues.  The exchange first offered heatbased indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering  contracts based on cold weather.  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

Breaking news:

Leon County circuit Judge Terry Lewis has just rejected a
court petition by Vice President Al Gore to force Florida to
accept hand recounted votes.  This ruling clears the way for
the Florida Division of Elections to certify the final vote
tally tomorrow.

That's great news -- but the post-election battle is not over
yet.

""Hand counting"" of ballots is still going on at this very
minute in Palm Beach and Broward counties.  If the ruling by
Judge Lewis stands, Florida's Division of Elections can
throw out these ""hand counts.""  But the Gore legal team is
appealing the decision today and it's very likely that the
Florida Supreme Court will be hearing the case shortly.

The Florida Supreme Court is comprised of six Democrats and
1 independent, and they've already ruled in Gore's favor to
allow the ""hand counting"" of ballots earlier this week.

Yes, this situation is still a mess.   That's why it's still
important for us to be mobilizing in favor of fair election
practices and integrity in the ballot counting process.  The
votes were counted on election day -- and George W. Bush won
Florida.  The votes were recounted in the days that followed
-- and George W. Bush won Florida.

Now the Democrats have hand picked a couple of counties
where they think they can manufacture enough votes to make
up the difference through ""hand counting"" of ballots.
What's worse is they're using ballot examining techniques
that amount to mind reading to determine whether or not
voters meant to vote for Al Gore.

Thank you for signing your Petition to block these
objectionable ""hand counts"" and Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  Every day we pick up more supporters (we're
closing in on 200,0000!) and every day we pick up more media
recognition as we swamp Florida with your Petitions.

Here's the bottom line: we are not going to let Al Gore
steal this election.   Send anyone and everyone who might be
interested in fighting for the integrity of this election to
http://www.electionintegrity2000.com to sign our petition
and see breaking news on the action in Florida right now.

Thanks,

You need to set up a transport capacity ticket in Sitara for this.  Heidi 
Withers should be able to help you.  I don't know the contract to apply to

On October 29, 2001, the commission issues an order instituting a rulemaking
to establish ratemaking mechanisms to enable SCE, PG&E and SDG&E to resume
purchasing electric energy, capacity ,ancillary services and related hedging
instrument to full their obligation to serve their customers once DWR's
authority to purchase on their behalf ends (December 31, 2001). At that
point, the UDCs, not DWR, will have to pick up anything not covered by
retained generation and the DWR contracts.  The Commission will also address
proposals on how renewable resources should be included in the mix of
generation serving the state. The OIR will have a significant impact on
procurement practices in the state on a going forward basis.    The ruling
states that if you are interested in being on the service list for this
proceeding, a letter must be sent to the docket office stating that fact
within 15 days (by next Monday).

Bottom line is do you want me to continue to monitor (and perhaps get
active) in this proceeding.  Please let me know by the end of the week so
that I can send in the required letter.

The Cilco volumes are different than the confirmed volumes to Cilco.  Please 
review the attached the spreadsheets from Lisa Kinsey, the central desk 
scheduler responsible for the Cilco account.  The biggest variance is in 
January 2000.  Cilco withdrew 200,000 mmbtu's more than we booked @ bammel.  
Please let me know the best way to correct the problem.  I suspect the 
variance is showing up as a transport imbalance.  Also, the nomination for 
the current month is 7,327 mmbtu instead of 7,000 mmbtu per day.  7,000 is 
the volume delivered to Cilco after transport fuel.

FERC expands El Paso Pipeline hearing on Calif
(UPDATE: adds NYMEX closing price)

By Julie Vorman

WASHINGTON, June 11 (Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday expanded a legal 
proceeding into whether El Paso Corp (NYSE:EPG - news) affiliates improperly 
shared information to boost the price of natural gas deliveries into 
energy-starved California.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) reversed an earlier decision 
and granted a request by the California Public Utilities Commission for a 
hearing on the activities of El Paso Pipeline, El Paso Merchant Energy-Gas 
L.P., and Mojave Pipeline Co.

All are involved in shipping natural gas into California, where utilities 
depend on the fuel to run electricity generating plants.

The California Public Utilities Commission alleged that the El Paso 
affiliates' three shipping contracts for 1,220 million cubic feet per day of 
guaranteed capacity to California were rigged to boost prices during much of 
last year. Utilities and state regulators claim the high prices cost 
Californians an extra $3.7 billion, a figure disputed by El Paso.

AFFILIATE ABUSE AT ISSUE

FERC, which regulates interstate pipelines and electricity markets, had said 
in March that it found no sign of what is known in the industry as affiliate 
abuse. The agency has rules requiring arms-length deals within a corporate 
family.

``The commission now sets for hearing the issue of whether El Paso Pipeline 
and/or El Paso Merchant engaged in affiliate abuse or violated the affiliate 
standards in bidding for or awarding the El Paso contracts, including the 
transportation discount granted by Mojave,'' FERC said in the Monday order.

The new hearing will become part of an ongoing case in which FERC 
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner is trying to determine if El Paso 
deliberately curbed gas shipments to boost prices.

Although California prices eased in recent days, they have soared as much as 
100 times higher than other states.

El Paso has denied any wrongdoing.

``The bottom line is that FERC had all the evidence before them when they 
made their initial decision (in March) that there was no affiliate abuse. And 
that evidence has not changed,'' said Norma Dunn, a spokeswoman for El Paso.

``We're very confident that they will rule in the same fashion again,'' she 
added.

In late March, FERC ordered the first El Paso proceeding to determine if the 
company exercised market power to drive up the price of natural gas in 
California. But FERC also rejected at that time allegations that El Paso 
Pipeline had improperly favored its affiliates during the so-called ``open 
season'' when pipelines accept bids for contract deliveries.

The new FERC action came after California regulators alleged that El Paso 
Merchant received secret information from Mojave during the open season.

``The commission now believes these allegations raise factual issues that are 
best resolved in an evidentiary hearing,'' the FERC order said.

Separately, Judge Wagner asked FERC for ``guidance'' on whether he should 
gather evidence on possible violations of the affiliate standards, which 
could have influenced prices.

PUNISHMENT REMAINS UNCLEAR

On the New York Merchantile Exchange (NYMEX), Hub gas prices for July rallied 
25.7 cents, or almost seven percent, to close at $4.179 per million British 
thermal units (mmBtu) on Monday.

Under the FERC order, Judge Wagner has until June 21 to set a date for a 
hearing on the new issue.

The agency also said it was premature to identify what punishment is 
available if Judge Wagner determines that El Paso improperly exercised market 
power.

The expanded proceeding means that a Sept. 4 deadline for a decision by Judge 
Wagner has been suspended, FERC said.

The FERC order was endorsed by new FERC commissioner Pat Wood, a former Texas 
utilities regulator and confidant of President George W. Bush. Wood joined 
FERC earlier this month and is widely rumored to be in line to head the 
agency.

Current FERC chairman, Curtis Hebert, a Mississippi Republican, took over the 
leadership role in January at the insistence of then-Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott.

In a concurring opinion filed with the new FERC order, Wood wrote that the 
agency must ``act expeditiously'' on complaints. The El Paso allegations were 
first raised in April 2000 but FERC did not move on the case until nearly one 
year later.

``In overseeing competitive energy markets as a joint effort with our 
colleagues at state commissions, it is critical that the FERC be seen as a 
watchful and vigilant partner,'' Wood wrote. ``Expeditious referral and 
action on filed complaints is a central tool in our market oversight 
toolbox.''

Hebert also wrote a concurring opinion, in which he said he was committed to 
a speedy resolution of the case.

Utilities and state regulators claim the high prices cost Californians an extra $3.7 billion, a figure disputed by El Paso.AFFILIATE ABUSE AT ISSUEFERC, which regulates interstate pipelines and electricity markets, had said in March that it found no sign of what is known in the industry as affiliate abuse. The agency has rules requiring armslength deals within a corporate family.``The commission now sets for hearing the issue of whether El Paso Pipeline and/or El Paso Merchant engaged in affiliate abuse or violated the affiliate standards in bidding for or awarding the El Paso contracts, including the transportation discount granted by Mojave,'' FERC said in the Monday order.The new hearing will become part of an ongoing case in which FERC Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner is trying to determine if El Paso deliberately curbed gas shipments to boost prices.Although California prices eased in recent days, they have soared as much as 100 times higher than other states.El Paso has denied any wrongdoing.``The bottom line is that FERC had all the evidence before them when they made their initial decision (in March) that there was no affiliate abuse. And that evidence has not changed,'' said Norma Dunn, a spokeswoman for El Paso.``We're very confident that they will rule in the same fashion again,'' she added.In late March, FERC ordered the first El Paso proceeding to determine if the company exercised market power to drive up the price of natural gas in California. But FERC also rejected at that time allegations that El Paso Pipeline had improperly favored its affiliates during the socalled ``open season'' when pipelines accept bids for contract deliveries.The new FERC action came after California regulators alleged that El Paso Merchant received secret information from Mojave during the open season.``The commission now believes these allegations raise factual issues that are best resolved in an evidentiary hearing,'' the FERC order said.Separately, Judge Wagner asked FERC for ``guidance'' on whether he should gather evidence on possible violations of the affiliate standards, which could have influenced prices.PUNISHMENT REMAINS UNCLEAROn the New York Merchantile Exchange (NYMEX), Hub gas prices for July rallied 25.7 cents, or almost seven percent, to close at $4.179 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) on Monday.Under the FERC order, Judge Wagner has until June 21 to set a date for a hearing on the new issue.The agency also said it was premature to identify what punishment is available if Judge Wagner determines that El Paso improperly exercised market power.The expanded proceeding means that a Sept. 4 deadline for a decision by Judge Wagner has been suspended, FERC said.The FERC order was endorsed by new FERC commissioner Pat Wood, a former Texas utilities regulator and confidant of President George W. Bush. Wood joined FERC earlier this month and is widely rumored to be in line to head the agency.Current FERC chairman, Curtis Hebert, a Mississippi Republican, took over the leadership role in January at the insistence of thenSenate Majority Leader Trent Lott.In a concurring opinion filed with the new FERC order, Wood wrote that the agency must ``act expeditiously'' on complaints. The El Paso allegations were first raised in April 2000 but FERC did not move on the case until nearly one year later.``In overseeing competitive energy markets as a joint effort with our colleagues at state commissions, it is critical that the FERC be seen as a watchful and vigilant partner,'' Wood wrote. ``Expeditious referral and action on filed complaints is a central tool in our market oversight toolbox.''Hebert also wrote a concurring opinion, in which he said he was committed to a speedy resolution of the case.  rp00241000.pdf","['alan.comnes@enron.com', 'barry.tycholiz@enron.com', 'christi.nicolay@enron.com', 'dave.perrino@enron.com', 'don.black@enron.com', 'donna.fulton@enron.com', 'jalexander@gibbs-bruns', 'james.steffes@enron.com', 'jeff.dasovich@enron.com', 'jennifer.thome@enron.com', 'leslie.lawner@enron.com', 'paul.kaufman@enron.com', 'phillip.allen@enron.com', 'ray.alvarez@enron.com', 'robert.frank@enron.com', 'sandra.mccubbin@enron.com', 'stephanie.miller@enron.com', 'steve.walton@enron.com', 'susan.mara@enron.com', 'ed.mcmichael@enron.com', 'jane.tholt@enron.com', 'jess.hewitt@enron.com', 'patti.sullivan@enron.com', 'randall.gay@enron.com', 'robert.superty@enron.com', 'roger.ponce@enron.com', 'suzanne.calcagno@enron.com', 'tori.kuykendall@enron.com']",28

Can you get a positive upside over the costs for next summer at least?  Also, 
we think that in order to set up a load only control area, you have to have 
firm transmission paths to generation sources (but if you  want to pursue 
this, I need to pull the NERC rules on that issue to be certain of the 
requirements.  We only set up generation only control areas.  Mary, the 6 or 
so requirements are on the NERC web site.)  thanks.

We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric.  
My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off 
LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, 
at least if their transmission is in RTO West.

Subject: West control area

Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this?  There have been a variety of 
problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy 
order.  Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation 
only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC 
filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want 
that result in a FERC order.)  In addition, while you were on vacation, 
Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project.  I don't know the 
status of that.  I am in a room reviewing etrans tariff, so page me if you 
want to talk about it.  800-778-8365.  Thanks.

Mary, the 6 or so requirements are on the NERC web site.)  thanks.Mary Hain11/03/2000 11:11 AMTo: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECTcc: Sean Crandall/PDX/ECT@ECT@ECT, Paul Choi/SF/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: West control area  We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric.  My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off LV Cogen.

There have been a variety of problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy order.

Subject: CES Booking of Transport--annuities to desk

I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think 
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example, 
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
working).

Thanks.

SVMG Energy Committee Members and Liaison Representatives:

The CEC recently launched the Innovative Peak Load Reduction
Program which provides grants for reducing peak electrical demand.
Supporting the SVMG Energy Policy,  this program will pay up to $250
per kW, and up to 75% of the costs for projects that achieve load
reduction between the hours of 2:00PM-6:00PM, June through
September.  Attached is a flyer that gives an overview of the
program and the scheduled seminars that explain the grant program.

A seminar is being conducted on Tuesday, June 26, at the San
Francisco Airport Holiday Inn to explain the program and the
application process.  There is no charge for the seminar and a full
complementary breakfast will be provided.  The seminar starts at
7:00AM and is about an hour.

Take advantage of this opportunity to get a state grant to help defer
the cost of energy efficiency projects.

Thank you for your consideration.

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) New Aluminum Bottle Products May Lead to
Increased Aluminum Usage in the Beverage Packaging Industry, in an
Advisory by Industrialinfo.com

    Business Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 15, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources Inc.;
Houston, Texas). About a year and a half ago, Daiwa Can Company,
Japan's largest aluminum can producer, began producing aluminum
bottles for beer and tea companies. The novelty has caught on in Japan
where the company produced approximately 480 million aluminum bottles
in 2001. Along with two other manufacturers of aluminum bottles,
capacity is expected to double over the next 2-3 years. All three
manufacturers of aluminum bottles in Japan are contemplating line
additions or expansions at this time.
	   The aluminum bottle can has all the attributes of the aluminum
beverage can, it is lightweight and recyclable, but is shaped like a
bottle. It comes with a resealable aluminum screw on cap, which is
also recyclable. Aluminum bottles are expected to take market share
back from PET (Plastic) bottles, which have grown in popularity lately
and have replaced both glass & metal in some markets. It's only a
matter of time before this product catches on in the U.S. and other
international markets.
	   Industrialinfo.com provides daily news related to the industrial
market place including forecasts, outlooks, industry alerts, and
databases for the energy and industrial markets. For more information
on trends and upcoming construction activities for the Metals &
Minerals or Energy markets as well as other industrial sectors send
inquiries to metalsandmineralsgroup@industrialinfo.com or visit us at

The attached spreadsheet allows you to easily calculate Eco's year-end LNG inventory for a variety of cases that vary dispatch rate, # days of outage for CT1, and number of cargoes diverted between now and year-end. Simply enter your assumption for number of days of CT1 outage in cell A16 and the number of cargoes you want to divert in cell A23. The year-end inventory is automatically calculated. A negative number means that you require more LNG than you are entitled to receive.

Assuming that you want the LNG tank full at year-end:

1. Eco will be able to receive 100% of the remaining 6 cargoes if the CT1 outage is 60 days or less

2. 175 days of CT1 outage are required to result in Eco being able to divert 1 cargo and still have a full tank at year-end

3. a 60-175 day outage for CT1 results in surplus LNG but whether or not it is enough to market depends on how much the outage exceeds 60 days

The above figures assume a 76% dispatch and 95% availability on days that Eco is not assumed to be in an outage.

Several weeks ago Ecogas entered into an LOI to sell substantially all of the 
assets to a company called Pacific Natural Energy in return for cash ($3.25 
MM) and forgiveness of debt ($750K) at the Ecogas Corp. level.  The assets 
being acquired are as follows:

Ecogas McCommas Bluff, Inc. (100% of the securities)
Ecovest-Nelson Gardens, LLC (100% of Ecogas' equity = 50.1% of the project 
equity)
Medio Creek, LLC (100% of the securities)
Rosenberg project (currently an Ecogas Corp. asset, not an SPV)
both the Skyline and Westside projects (also currently Ecogas Corp. assets)

PNE is NOT acquiring Ecogas' 50% W.I. in Fresh Gas, LLC (the other 50% owned 
by Montauk Energy).  Ecogas is settling all outstanding accounts, issues, 
etc... with Montauk via a ""global settlement"" which will include Ecogas 
transferring to Montauk its 50% equity in Fresh Gas.  

PNE paid $150K as a down payment (when the LOI was signed) and will fund the 
balance at closing with the exception of a 10% holdback ($325K) for a 6 month 
period to cover unknown contingencies.  The net cash at closing ($2.775MM) is 
being used as follows:

$139K to bring the bonds at McCommas Bluff (which is being acquired by PNE) 
current
$75 - 100K for misc. legal contingencies (pending litigation)
$118K to true up a Letter of Credit for the Rosenberg project which Ecogas 
used for W/C
$101K to settle 70+ Tier 2 (<$10K ea.) Creditors = 100 cents/$
$1,953K to settle 20+ Tier 1 (>$10K ea.) Creditors, including Montauk Energy 
= 50 cents/$
$380K to settle the 5 Employment Contracts = 50 cents/$
The balance of funds, if any, will be used as a ""cushion"" against misc 
unexpected/unknown items

As part of the creditor settlements mentioned above, Ecogas will have 
executed Separation and Release Agreements with all 5 employees currently 
under Employment Contracts, including Jerrel Branson.  However, as part of 
Jerrel's settlement, he will agree to transfer ownership of his 15% equity in 
Ecogas Corp. back to either the company or over to ENA.  After the 
transaction is completed, Ecogas Corp. will essentially be a shell company 
with only one project asset left, which is in Austin.  Ecogas' intent is to 
notify the City of Austin (after closing the sale to PNE) that it intends to 
exercise its ""commercial out"" under the contract with the City.  Once this is 
done Ecogas will only have misc assets (desks, computers, etc... which PNE 
doesn't want) and a small amount of cash (maybe $20-50K) left (not including 
any money from the 10% holdback which may be refunded after 6 months).  Our 
intent is to have all the remaining files, records, etc... transferred here 
to Enron (I will have them shipped to me) as ENA will be the only shareholder 
left.  

Let me know if there are any other issues, action items, etc... I need to 
initiate in order to make the final transition to ENA complete.  If you have 
any questions or if I can be of any assistance please don't hesitate to call 
me at x33212.

Susan, Tana,

Could you please let Dee Travella at FUNB know the status of the Master 
Agreement between ENA or ECTRC and FUNB. She has today received a schedule 
for a Master Agreement between FUNB and Enron Credit.com. However, the credit 
default swap traded with FUNB was done through ENA.

 I should be grateful for your assistance in this regard.

Many thanks,
Elaine Bannerman-Sowah

			Open Enrollment for your 2002 Health Benefits begins Monday, October 29, 2001!  

Q. 	WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
A. 	If you plan to make changes to your existing benefit coverage, you will need to make changes during Open Enrollment which begins 	Monday, October 29, 2001 at 8:00 AM (Central) and ends on November 12, 2001 at 5:00 PM (Central)
	
	To facilitate these changes, you received an Open Enrollment Benefit Packet at your home address.  This packet contains a personalized 	worksheet and the Enron Instruction Guide to help you make your selections.  
	(If you have not received your Info Packet, please let us know ASAP! ) 


Q.	WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?
	1.  If you are satisfied with your current elections and do not need to make changes, do nothing.  Your current choices will automatically roll 	over to 2002. 

	2.  If you plan to make changes to your coverage, you will need to either access the Intranet website at work:  benefits.enron.com    
	or at home at  www.Enron.BenefitsNow.com   or call the Phone Enrollment Line at (800) 332-7979, Option 5.


Q. 	I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS.  I NEED MORE INFORMATION. 
A.	If you have more questions or need more information, you may attend our Open Enrollment ""Brown Bag"" Info Session being held on Friday, 	October 26 @ 11:30 PM in the Mt Hood Conference Room.  

See you then!

Just a quick note, since it is conveniently summarised below, for you to see 
the various import/export authorisations (to/from Spain, hence the reference 
to Pool) Alfredo Huertas has secured for the commercial teams (Iberia, plus 
France).   mcs

Subject: Additional import/export authorisation

Please, find attached .tif file containing the authorisation to our new 
import/export requests:





As you could see in the attachment, the DGPEyM has made a mistake regarding 
the import authorisation from Portugal. It is not clear if number 9 above is 
50 MW or 200MW, or if 8+9 cannot be more than 200 MW. David is checking with 
the DGPEyM the reason for this.

David will be sending to DGPEyE and OMEL and REE the non-economic conditions 
of the transactions, using the same templates as in the past. 

Pedro, could you start contacting emilio cortes and ree to anticipate them 
the contents of the new authorisations?

Kal,

This is the first draft based on what students from Rice working on a project
produced. Of course, they were free to say what they thought.

Our objective is to modify the article  to such an extent that
it can be a useful source of information about alternative electronic trading platforms
in the energy industry.
It would be only for internal consumption and it should be  a useful source of information 
for Enron employees.


Ken Parkhill from my group will work with you on editing this paper.

Vince -- Even if we post this internally, I have some concern about the heading of this article and with the section with recommendations for EnronOnline.  Is this something we really need to do?  If so, pls. let me know since we'll have to edit some of the text and make it very clear that this is simply an article written by some students outside Enron and Enron does not agree or disagree with the content.  We would also have to add a note that this article is for internal use only.  We can discuss and finalize on Tues.

Bob,

Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
about EOL from which we extracted this article.
We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).

Who else could help to review it?

Vince

Steel Origination=20
Since its inception in September, the steel group has grown to over 40=20

physical and financial trades and has 10 products posted on EnronOnline.

Steel prices are at a 20-year low, several large producers have recently=20

both liquidity and price risk management. At this time, Enron is the only=

company offering these products. A middle-market group has recently been=20
formed, which will allow the originators to focus on longer term deals with=

GLOBAL FLASH

UK Gas Update
This week the Bacton- Zeebrugge Interconnector surprised the market by=20
switching flow direction from UK Import to Export despite European spot=20
prices being lower than UK prices.  The Interconnector's operating rules=20
allow this to happen at present. Several shippers are lobbying to have thes=
e=20
rules amended to be able to react more quickly to market forces.  This flow=
=20
direction switch coincided with the recent cold snap increasing demand=20
substantially to 430mcm which in turn has resulted in a surge in prompt UK=
=20
prices. =20

EOL activity during this period has been particularly active as we benefit=
=20
from the increased volatility in the market.=20

Enron has several fuel switching options at our Teesside installations whic=
h=20
we use to protect our positions.

Fine weather in Japan
Over the New Year, Enron Japan completed a weather transaction with BTM,=20
which acted as a broker to the deal.  The deal, whereby we bought the optio=
n,=20
involved a Jan/Feb average temperature call with a maximum payout of 500 mi=
ll=20
JPY.   The transaction acted as a trigger leading to further transactions. =
=20
While not a major deal financially, this deal is significant as it offers a=
n=20
indication that the Japanese weather market is developing and is growing in=
=20
size.  Takuro Shioda in our Tokyo office did a great job during the=20
negotiations. =20

TPS Gains ISO 14001 Accreditation
On 30th November Teesside Power Station gained accreditation to the=20
internationally recognised Environmental Management System (EMS) ISO 14001=
=20
standard.

ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies the requirements for =
an=20
environmental management system that TPS had to meet in order to achieve=20
third-party certification. The accreditation will encourage cultural change=
=20
by establishing disciplines that ensure policy objectives are met and a=20
continual improvement in environmental performance is achieved.

to our group!? The Kick-Off is scheduled for 8:30  a.m.

to put on programs for business owners with the  sole purpose of helping 
those business owners grow their businesses.? This  will be the 9thh annual

Try not to pester you new associate to death with all your questions.  
Congrats on getting help.  Maybe this means the hazing is over.

Aleluya, my boss talked to one associate in the group so he can sit by me and 
help me in case I have any questions. ANY??? Maybe he can sit by me and just 
explain everything from scratch. Anyways, just wanted to let you know. 

Bye.

Paige wrote me at 430 this am, and said that since she was still up at 430, 
she probably won't be home in time for Michael's parties.  Should I just 
leave him after gymnastics?  I don't really want to come back the office, but 
I do want to go to Anne's.  Hmmm.  If Paige is home by 500, everything might
